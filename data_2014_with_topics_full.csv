I have also been supporting Not On Our Watch, an incredible organization that's dedicated to putting an end to mass atrocities around the world, and generates lifesaving humanitarian assistance and protection. I am doing a campaign with them where I am offering anyone who donates the chance to fly to LA with a friend and be my guest at an exclusive scoring session of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, where you will get to hear the score and see clips from the film before anyone else, and you'll also get a tour of my studio.

2011,1441939124,"Hi, I’m Fat Mike.

I play bass and sing in NOFX and sometimes play bass in Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. I’m also president of Fat Wreck Chords (http://www.fatwreck.com/) and occasionally go into the office for meetings. I sorta produce bands at my studio Motor Studios. I co-own a dungeon in downtown LA called Dungeon Snakeoil, where I also like to spend my weekends. When I’m not taking my daughters to school or writing songs, I’m usually badly golfing or riding my bike around San Francisco.  I like taking all kinds of drugs and drinking in excess but only when I’m on tour, or out of town. I recently got engaged to my long time girlfriend and Domme, Soma Snakeoil. Sound confusing? It is…. Oh, also I’m a bowling champion!

Whats new? NOFX has the second season of our cancelled TV show Backstage Passport coming out on DVD in a few months. We also are putting finishing touches on a NOFX tell all book that will be out by Christmas.

Also, My restaurant in Brooklyn, Thistle Hill Tavern is a having a special on Korean Beef (http://www.thistlehillbrooklyn.com/) Tell em Fatty sent you.

I am an economist at George Mason University (GMU) with a PhD from Princeton University, and I'm an advocate of both free immigration and free trade, which align most with the libertarian ideal.

I run a blog at EconLog: http://econlog.econlib.org/authorbcaplan.html#recent

I'm here to answer any questions you might have about my work, my political theory, or my two published books:

- Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids: Why Being a Great Parent is Less Work and More Fun Than You Think

- The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies

I'm really excited to have launched yesterday the new Ken Burns app for the iPad, which is the first time I’ve entered the digital realm this way. We've taken short clips from 35 years of my films covering over 200 years of American history and assembled them both thematically and chronologically. The playlist and timeline features of the app offer you the opportunity to experience my films in a whole new way. You can check it out here:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ken-burns/id723854283?ls=1&amp;mt=8 .
 
I also have some new projects on the horizon, including The Address on PBS on April 15, and The Roosevelts this fall. I look forward to answering your questions at 4:30.

**First of all - we're in pre-production for the FINAL SEASON of Video Game High School and there’s less than a week left on our crowd funding campaign for Season 3!**

**[Click here to support Season 3!](http://rocketjump.com/campaign)**

Anyway - Freddie Wong here. You may know me as the face of the http://youtube.com/freddiew channel (now http://youtube.com/rocketjump) I've been making short visual effects-y action videos for exactly four years now.

We’ve gotten back to making a new short every week - here are some of them!

**[Ping Pong Masters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Rt899XyLE)**

In 2012, I teamed up with my friends Matt and Dez to create RocketJump with the goal of going beyond making YouTube shorts. We’ve created two seasons of Video Game High School, a TV-length web series about an alternate reality where gaming is so huge, high schools exist to train kids. Both those seasons are available on YouTube, RocketJump.com, and [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/Video-Game-High-School).

VGHS was named [Variety’s #1 Webseries of 2013](http://variety.com/gallery/top-10-web-series-of-2013/#!1/introduction/), and our company RocketJump was recently named one of the [10 Most Innovative Companies in Hollywood](http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2014/industry/hollywood)
 by Fast Company.

We’ve done quite a bit in this weird, new, world where traditional entertainment is starting to crack and new independent producers and movie creators are figuring out how to make things. We’ll be as open and honest about our experiences - so fire away!

[News coverage on Yahoo](http://news.yahoo.com/ethiopian-plane-hijacked-geneva-co-pilot-083155442.html) 

[Proof](http://i.imgur.com/UOtuNSi.jpg): Luggage tag.

The plane was hijacked one hour after take-off. This is how it went down. 

After entering the plane, I went to my seat: economy class, window-side and next to the right wing. As it was around midnight, I quickly fell asleep during take-off. I was waken up an hour later due to the sound of all the oxygen mask going down. I immediatly thought « what the... » I looked at my neighbor, she seemed as confused at me: the plane was not behaving oddly so I thought it was a simple technical glitch or somebody pressed the wrong button. Everybody looked at each other, thinking what’s going on. Suddenly, a deep and angry voice talked through the cabin radio: ""SIT DOWN, PUT YOUR MASKS ON, I'M CUTTING THE OXYGEN"", three times. At this point, I realized that the situation is serious: someone is in the pilot cabin and has hijacked the plane. Within a few seconds, the oxygen went down in the cabin: I felt very lightheaded and quickly decided to put on the oxygen mask like the rest of the passengers. Quickly after that, the plane suddenly started dropping down for about 8 seconds then went fast back up, then finally stablized. People were crying, yelling, praying. I was in complete panic. Cold.
We were then waiting for an update, an information, what was going on. But it never came. We flew for 6 more hours, knowing only that a pirate was at command. Who was he, what was his intentions ? I started thinking, too far. For he was probably alone, he couldn’t possibly be planning to land at an airport, he would immediatly get caught. So I quickly took away the possibilty of landing safely. As I was looking throught the window, all I could see was dark. Dark up, dark down.

For the next 6 hours, I was imagining every possible outcome of this story : from suddenly crashing into the ocean, to hitting a building, to crashing into another plane, to landing and being killed as a martyr. At this point, I remember trying to send a SMS to my family and girlfriend « There is a problem with the plane. I love you, you are the best » on a 5% battery and stressing that another terrorist would see me and shoot me. There was no network, so I decided to shut down my phone and thought of restarting it just before we crashed, so the messages would eventually come through. 
I held hands the whole way with my seat neighboor, a very nice, simple older italian woman. Every single second of those 6 hours of uncertainty and soon-to-be death was a psychological torture. I broke down, let everything go, said goodbye, though of my family, of moments in the past, of who will inherit my stuff and much more.

The flight was supposed to land at Rome at 4:40am. At 5:30am we were still high, high in the sky. Down throught the window , I could see a coast and some light far away that somehow reassured me. Around 5:45, the plane started suddenly to do circle. Circles left, circle right. It seemed that this went on at least 20 times. I was thinking that maybe the pirate wants to deplete the fuel and stall the plane. We were still at the same altitude, we were not going towards land. After this terribly long sequence of turns, the plane started going down towards land at a normal speed. When we reached the clouds, the wings deployed completely like a normal landing, but it seemed to me like it wanted to cover more area to do more damage. I was thinking : that’s it, we’re crashing into something. Looking down to the window I see a light, two, three, I can’t see what’s ahead. It’s still dark. We’re going fast, we’re flying over many houses now.
And suddenly, under us, the airport. Just thinking again about this moment makes me shiver. We are landing. WE, are LANDING. Is this true ? Is this a miracle ? 
We touched the ground, and the plane eventually stopped completely in a bit away from the plane entrance to the terminal. I remember crying, while most of the people (Italians) were applauding.
At this point, for the first time in 6 hours, we got an update from the steward telling us about the copilot, that we are in Geneva and that soon the Swiss police will enter and evacuate the plane. 
Eventually, the Swiss tactical forces entered the plane, telling is to put our hands on the head and stay calm. It took about 2-3 minutes person person to evacuate. An hour later, I was finally out. We were checked and accompagnied very kindly by the swiss. There were sandwitches, hot chocolate, free wifi and psychologues. A few hours later, I could get my luggage and went out through normal gates. My mother was there, we went for a walk along the Leman lake and she cooked some good meal.
The psychological impact is not negligible, I'm still in a state of shock. I'm a lucky bastard, I hope none of you have to experience that. AMA.

 **tl;dr: Got to plane, after an hour the oxygen mask went down, scary voice through radio, plane going fast up and fast down, no update during 6 hours and finally landed safely. Miracle.** 

Edit: English Grammar / Added News Article

Edit: Why was my mother in Geneva? 
My final destination was Geneva, I work there. I had a flight from Rome to Geneva just after this one. As I was coming back from holidays, she had long planned on taking her days off to visit her friends in my hometown (1 hour away, France) and by the same occasion, visit me. In the end, I am very thankful and lucky to have her outside of the airport when I came out.

Edit: Honestly and truly thank you to everybody on this thread. 

Edit: Thank you kind person for the Gold! I will treasure it.

Edit: I'm taking a break to eat a Swiss Fondue. Thank you everyone so much for your question and support. Sorry for all the questions I didn't answer. Stay classy reddit, let's learn from this story and make the world a better place.

Edit: Good night reddit, will continue answering tommorow!

Edit: Sorry about the martyr part, I should have researched the meaning more before talking about it.

Edit: As a redditor pointed, the oxygen didn't went down in the cabin, it could only be the pressure. It is even likely than nothing happened and I felt lightheaded because of the panic.

Edit: I feel like I didn't emphasize on how the Ethiopian Airlines flight attendants were reassuring, professional and very helpful.

-Location: I'm not getting anymore specific than I live near Toronto, Canada.  
   
-Account name: This is a throwaway account I have had for a little while now and when I made it I never planned on uploading pictures of my balls. The name is related to my past (and admittedly illegal) psychedelic use. I have since discontinued ANY ILLEGAL DRUG USE. Other than alcohol I have not used anything in months.  The name is a reference to magic mushrooms. Mushrooms can be found in some gardens. Gandalf is magic. Simple.

One of the reasons we've been gone:

Hai internetz!

We are Regular Ordinary Swedish Meal Time! A (tutorial) cooking show on YouTube. 

We are returning to YouTube… Today!! Check out the Swedish channel-trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4zc3O4Z7v8
The first new episode will be out April 3rd, and from then on, we will upload videos in a format similar to Tabletop and Spellslingers: 
1st week: EPISODE - 2nd week: BLOOPER - 3rd week: EPISODE - 
4th week: BLOOPER - 5th week: EPISODE - etc etc
and so on! We might upload some more bonus stuff as well :)

Why are we returning? Basically, we have better routines now with our day to day jobs - making it easier to pinpoint when and where we have time to do something. We are also getting help and resources (first and foremost the kitchen!) from a local Swedish YouTube network, which is great. Destroying kitchens became a part of our show back in the day, but reason behind it was that we had no other choice (no one would let us cook in the same place twice!). Having a regular kitchen to return to makes it a lot easier for us to pland and produce videos!

For those of you who do not know us, here is the crash course:

We first started our channel back in January 2011 while we were studying for our bachelor degrees! After about one semester, our studies were just about done and we got spread out throughout the country, making it really hard to get together and cook more for you. Me and Niklas started studying at a 2 year masters programme, Tom was working as a developer, and Isak and Anders was way down south in Sweden.

During this entire time, we have frequently been thinking about SwedishMealTime, what it means to us, why we stopped making videos and the future of the show. This could potentially be a very long story, but the TL:DR version is that:


1. We didn’t have enough time or manpower, combining ROSMT with our studies and work.

2. Even if we did make an effort, it was too much work and we felt the quality of the show was suffering from it. We don’t want to compromise on that.


So why didn’t we communicate more about this?
Partly because we didn’t know if this was the end, or just a long-ass break. It was probably a big mistake and it could have been handled a lot better. Anyway, we’d want to focus on the future now, and what lays ahead, with our fortunes and misfortunes behind us.


TL:DR
We stopped making videos more than a year ago, but are now returning because we have jobs (making it easier to plan around that), more of us live closer to one another now (much like we did in the first episodes!), we have a kitchen to return to and we can plan accordingly! Thus our return is imminent!


TL:DR THE TL:DR 
We’re back, bitch.

2995,1441588322,"I'm a 32-year-old Irish man on a mission to circumnavigate the world without flying. I started from Ireland in 2011 and have made my way east through 25 countries so far. Last month I reached the Americas after spending 26 days crossing the Pacific Ocean aboard a cargo ship. I'm currently stopped in Cusco, Peru for a few weeks.

Here's a video I made of my Pacific Ocean crossing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj9yA7KjIuw

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the questions. I'll check back regularly to answer more. If you're interested in hearing more about my travels, I wrote a book while on the cargo ship. Reviews have been excellent. Grab a copy here: http://www.ndoherty.com/books/cargo/

Cheers!


ANSWERS TO FAQ'S (to save me repeating myself):


Q. How much did it cost to cross the Pacific Ocean on a cargo ship?

A. About $4.5k including banking, exchange and insurance fees.


Q. Why is it so expensive?

A. Best I can tell, because the cargo ship companies don't care. Taking passengers isn't their primary business. They're transporting multi-million dollar cargoes, so they probably figure that if they're going to take the odd passenger, they might as well charge a high price to make it worth their while.


Q. How can I book travel aboard a cargo ship?

A. See here: www.ndoherty.com/cargo-ship-2/


Q. How do you afford to travel like this?

A. I work online, doing freelance web design mostly. Need help with a project? Contact me here: http://ndoherty.biz


Q. Do you pay taxes?

A. No. I’m not obliged to pay taxes in my home country (Ireland) if I’m not living there for more than six months out of the year. Same deal with the other countries I’m passing through on my travels. I’m never in any one place long enough to be considered a resident, so I’m always off the tax-paying hook.


Q. What was the highlight of your trip?

A. I'll give you a top four:

Flirting with 100+ women in Amsterdam http://www.ndoherty.com/flirt/

Running out of money in Iran: http://www.ndoherty.com/iran/

Falling in love in Siam: http://www.ndoherty.com/love/

Crossing the Pacific Ocean on a cargo ship: http://www.ndoherty.com/books/cargo/


Q. What's been your favorite place?

A. Amsterdam.


Q. Are you afraid of flying?

A. I have nothing against flying and flew quite regularly before starting this trip. I chose to embark on this no-fly adventure because I figured it would be a more interesting/challenging/adventurous way to travel.


Q. Where have you been so far?

A. Ireland &gt; England &gt; Netherlands &gt; Germany &gt; Switzerland &gt; Austria &gt; Hungary &gt; Romania &gt; Turkey &gt; Iran &gt; UAE &gt; India &gt; Nepal &gt; India &gt; Thailand &gt; Cambodia &gt; Laos &gt; Vietnam &gt; China &gt; Hong Kong &gt; China &gt; Vietnam &gt; Laos &gt; Thailand &gt; Laos &gt; China &gt; South Korea &gt; Japan &gt; Peru

1640,1441589031,"Hello from the Office for iPad engineering team!

In the first week since launch we’ve seen over 12 million app downloads and heard a lot of valuable feedback. We’re already incorporating that feedback into future updates, and to kick things into high gear, we are partnering with Reddit for the next 2 hours to give you an opportunity to ask us anything (well, nearly anything) about Office for iPad.  We have developers, testers and program managers from each app team (Word, Excel and PowerPoint for iPad) here to answer your questions.

We’re all so excited to finally be able to share what we’ve been up to – 
Right from engineering for the cloud, reimagining productivity for people on the go to optimizing for iPad while remaining true to our Office roots. We are very much looking forward to the conversation!

227,1441558904,"**My short bio:** The myths I’ve been trying to bust for my lifetime (The Myth of Male Power, etc) are reinforced daily--by President Obama (“unequal pay for equal work”); the courts (e.g., bias against dads); tragedies (mass school murderers); and the boy crisis. I’ve been writing so I haven’t weighed in. One of the things I’ve written is a 2014 edition of The Myth of Male Power. The ebook version allows for video links, and I’ve had the pleasure of creating a game App (Who Knows Men?) that was not even conceivable in 1993! The thoughtful questions from my last Reddit IAMA ers inspires me to reach out again! Ask me anything!

Thank you to http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/ for helping set up this AMA

Edit: Wow, what thoughtful and energizing questions. Well, I've been at this close to five hours now, so I'll take a break and look forward to another AMA. If you'd like to email me, my email is on www.warrenfarrell.com.

I'd just like to say it's been fun, really busy, some great questions and please remember, that if you are in the EU go and vote for someone you believe in on polling day!

Hi Everyone,


The three of us [Maria](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/maria-aretoulaki) (/u/PiratePartyUKMaria), [George](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/george-walkden) (/u/drgwalkden)  and [Jack](https://www.pirateparty.org.uk/jack-allnutt) (/u/m2ys4u) are standing in the North West of England for the European Parliamentary Elections.


So, ask us anything!

(And then go and vote for us on the 22nd. Obviously).


----

OK, so our candidates have been going at this for about 5 hours now, thanks for all the questions so far, I'm just adding a note to say that Maria has to go to a pane event on immigration to make the parties case and will get back to your questions later (and probably tomorrow). Jack and George should be around for a while longer. 

I'll also try to make sure any questions not aimed at a candidate get an answer from me, or someone else from the party too!

3669,1441223185,"I've been excited to announce this for months, since I first found out about it, quite by accident, when a friend sent me Ice-T's hilarious rant about narrating a D&amp;D story. As I read his blog, I said, ""Hey, that's my story!"" And yes it was...Audible.com has just released ""The Legend of Drizzt: The Collected Stories."" 

Each of the 12 stories is narrated by a different actor, and it's a line-up that I love: Sean Astin, Michael Chiklis, Wil Wheaton, Ice-T, Tom Felton, Weird AL Yankovic, David Duchovny, Greg Grunberg, Felicia Day, Melissa Rauch, Danny Pudi and Dan Harmon. 

Best of all for anyone interested in this, for the next 40 days - in honor of the 40th anniversary of D&amp;D - it's free! (You can pick individual stories, or get the whole collection.)

And here's my proof: https://www.facebook.com/pages/RA-Salvatore/54142479810

EDIT:

Okay, I have to run here. I've got to get packed for GenCon.

Thanks to everyone for participating or lurking, and I really appreciate the kind words I received here.

Thanks for walking this journey beside me.

Peace, Bob

ps. Check out that audio book! Some of my favorites are on there...including Felicia Day and Wil Wheaton, two convention friends!

pps. DemonWars: Reformation ships to kickstarter backers next week. It's available at my wife's on-line store (RASalvaStore.com), where you can get it (or any of my work) signed and even personalized.

ppps. Thanks again.

Hello reddit.
With all of the recent Comcast/Time warner cable hate, I thought I would do a AMA. 
I have been with Time Warner for over 10 years. I used to work for Cablevision,Adelphia and now Time Warner.
I have been a service tech, installer, and network tech. I am doing this anonymously. I will try to answer
all of your questions 100% with no BS. I can tell you that a lot,if not most, of TWC employees WANT this merger to happen for many reasons.
I have been in a lot of scary houses and can tell why your cable really doesn't work!

So go ahead reddit...
Ask Me ANYTHING. 


**
THESE ANSWERS ARE ALL 100% OPINION BASED AND ARE IN NO WAY REFLECTIVE OF TIME WARNER CABLE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. TIME WARNER CABLE DOES NOT SHARE THE VIEWS OF THE PERSON ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THESE ARE HIS/HER OWN OPINIONS AND HIS/HER OPINIONS ONLY!!!! Time warner takes no part in this whatsoever.

**Update #2: Thanks so much for all your questions! It's been fun! I'll pop back in tomorrow to check any last-minute questions.

Check your local listings. Hope to see you there! Scrumdiddlyumptiously, Paris.

I also grew up in Scotland, and although I live in New York now, my heart is in the Highlands. You’ve probably heard that Scotland's about to vote on whether or not to split from the rest of the UK. This is huge.

Last night, I answered some of Stephen Colbert’s questions on Scottish independence (FYI he supports a “Yes” vote) 

http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/16/stephen-colbert-backs-scottish-independence

I’ll be answering even more questions from you today about the independence referendum here.

Want to brush up? Here are a couple handy guides to Scottish independence from my colleagues at the Guardian:

And here's some more of my work for the Guardian - although I mostly edit other people's stories.

Go ahead &amp; AMA!

UPDATE 4.25pm ET - It's been great answering your questions. I have to go and do some more work right now but I'll try and check in tomorrow and answer some more. In the meantime the Guardian is doing loads of coverage including daily live blogs, the vote is on Thursday and the result will come sometime between 5am and 7am BST  Friday, which is midnight/2am ET.

3260,1441145913,"Last year I started cycling North of Cape Town in South Africa with a dream of cycling alone across the Continent. Since taking part in an AMA near the beginning of the trip (Dec 2013) - I since have cycled 12,000km from Cape Town to Cairo, Egypt entirely unsupported.

Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04T9VRVufw0

I slept mostly in a tent with all my supplies to survive on the bicycle and covered 11 Countries, many deserts, wildlife corridors and very isolated wilderness areas.

With no cycling experience prior to this trip and no training, the extremity of weather, isolation, physicality and risks involved contributed to the greatest experience I could have ever imagined.
 
In December 2013 I took part in an AMA which received much criticism and predictions for the dangers and bad that might happen on the rest of the trip;

Now that I‘ve cycled the length of Africa, please AMA

3730,1441087855,"Hi guys. This was supposed to be the 30th Anniversary, but I'm always a little late, so this is kind of the 31st or 32nd Anniversary, but I wanted to make sure that you had not only interesting tid-bits on the album, like demos and conversation, but I finally got to do a special on PBS that'll be released hopefully around Christmas so that people can finally get the whole album. I neva did the visual of a whole album, and I tried to find the first one, on the Fun Tour from '84, but all of it was disintegrated in their vaults, because, they basically, I guess they didn't think it was important to *save correctly!* I shoulda bought it from them, that's all, but they wouldn't sell in those days...

2508,1441088512,"Hi Reddit,

My name is Aaron Santos. I’m an author and physicist at [Simpson College](http://simpson.edu/) in Iowa.  People seemed to like [my last AMA](http://www.reddit.com/comments/uw3lk/iama_physicistauthor_ask_me_to_calculate_anything/), so I decided to do another one.

I’m not promoting a book this time, but I am looking for creative students interested in coming to Simpson and joining my research team. To identify students with unique problem solving skills, I’m holding an estimation contest during the first weekend of December. The winner will receive a $15,000 dollar scholarship to come to Simpson and work with the EMERGE@Simpson venture accelerator program. This program is ideal for students interested in (1) making money while doing science research in a college classroom setting and (2) using the scientific knowledge they learn in class to build startups that will push the limits of technology. Through EMERGE, I have many projects ongoing, including designing 3D displays and engineering new nanotech devices for applications in bioengineering, energy sustainability, and information technology. If you’d like to enter the Scholarship contest for a chance to come to Simpson, contact EMERGE@Simpson Director Chris Draper (chris.draper at simpson period edu) for details.

OK, enough of my blabbing.  Get your flaming burritos ready, Reddit.  Ask me to calculate anything!

I'm here to answer any and all questions about water policy and economics, i.e., on topics such as groundwater depletion, drought and shortage, floods and storms, environmental flows, human rights, bottled water, fracking, dead rivers, big dams, privatization, meters, corruption, water in slums, etc. I've looked into water issues in the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, China, India, France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Australia, NZ, S Africa, Brazil, Peru, Iceland... Just ask... I have lots of opinions and quite a few facts :)

4324,1441052203,"Hi guys. We are getting ready to do our second year of the  MST3K Turkey Day Revival (www.MST3KTurkeyDay.com). We had over 100,000 people tune in last year - it was a big success - so thank you for your support and we are happy to be bringing it back again this year.

A quick refresher for those who may not know what MST3K Turkey Day is: we will be streaming MST3K classics starting at 9 AM PST / 12 noon ET on Thanksgiving day on our official site, www.MST3KTurkeyDay.com. It is free and a better alternative than watching football.

Go ahead and AMA. Victoria's helping me get started.

3743,1441041349,"Hi all! This is Mikko Hypponen. 

I've been working with computer security since 1991 and I've tracked down various online attacks over the years. I've written about security, privacy and online warfare for magazines like *Scientific American* and *Foreign Policy*. I work as the CRO of [F-Secure](http://www.f-secure.com) in Finland.

I guess my talks are fairly well known. I've done the most watched computer security talk on the net. It's the first one of my three **TED** Talks:

* http://on.ted.com/Hypponen
* http://on.ted.com/Mikko3
* http://on.ted.com/NSAbetray 

Here's a talk from two weeks ago at **Slush**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u93kdtAUn7g

Here's a video where I tracked down the authors of the first PC virus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnedOWfPKT0

I spoke yesterday at **TEDxBrussels** and I was pretty happy on how the talk turned out. The video will be out this week.

**Edit:** 

I gotta go and catch a plane, thanks for all the questions! With over 3000 comments in this thread, I'm sorry I could only answer a small part of the questions.

**Update**: I loved these questions.

Because they were questions for a human being. And as a human being, I don't mind talking about it.

And I hope everyone gets a chance to check out the new album that is out today. We are super-super proud of it, and when people say it's the best album in years, they're not lying.

I work with frac when they pump too much sand downhole and I flow the sand out into the pit. I work with coil or a pulling unit drilling out frac plugs, and sometimes I sit on a well keeping track of how much oil the well is making.

I saw a lot of questions lately pertaining to the oilfield, so I figured I'd get in here.
