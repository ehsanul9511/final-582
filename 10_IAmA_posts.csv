Proof it's me: https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/240903767350968320

We're running early and will get started soon.

UPDATE: Hey everybody - this is barack. Just finished a great rally in Charlottesville, and am looking forward to your questions. At the top, I do want to say that our thoughts and prayers are with folks who are dealing with Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf, and to let them know that we are going to be coordinating with state and local officials to make sure that we give families everything they need to recover.

LAST UPDATE: I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run. AND REMEMBER TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER - if you need to know how to register, go to http://gottaregister.com. By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD!

Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden. While I'm sure my immediate prospects will improve in time, it's difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life -- to have a fulfilling career, to buy a house, to someday raise a family -- is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people. I know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many of us are demoralized. Your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics. We worked for you, we campaigned for you, and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you. What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?\n\nAnswer:\n>I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You're right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mom8)\n>What's the recipe for the White House's beer?\n\nAnswer:\n>It will be out soon! I can tell from first hand experience, it is tasty.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnz9)\n>What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term?\n\nAnswer:\n>Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmg8)\n>What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?\n\nAnswer:\n>The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm2v)\n>What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose?\n\nAnswer:\n>Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60ml11)\n>How are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014? and what if any bills are you going to implement for small businesses, in 2013, and 2014?\n\nAnswer:\n>We've really focused on this since I came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business, easier funding from the SBA. Going forward, I want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $250,000 or less in income, make it easier for small business to access financing, and expand their opportunities to export. And we will be implementing the Jobs Act bill that I signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd-funding and reduce their tax burden at the start-up stage.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm5n)\n>Who's your favourite Basketball player?\n\nAnswer:\n>Jordan - I'm a Bulls guy.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mlwx)\n>We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform?\n\nAnswer:\n>Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm41)\n>Are you considering increasing funds to the space program?\n\nAnswer:\n>Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmaf)\n>How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?\n\nAnswer:\n>It's hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I'm spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner.

It was a good place to start a family. Today, I am deeply concerned about the country we are calling home. The main reason is the political divide that seems to be deepening. The Republican party is moving more and more to the right. Coming from Germany, the surfacing hate, the uninhibited power play of those who feel they are entitled are of great concern. Citizen United was a great set back, fortunately, the health care law was able to prevail. - We observe disrespect for democratic rules in some political circles as well intolerance and a lack of compassion for minorities and those in need.

You have lead the country with dignity, compassion and foresight despite all obstacles and obstructions thrown in your way. Mr. President, my children, our youth, the whole country needs the leadership that you have to offer, today more than ever.

On top of this, my unit has been laden with what I would characterize as ""toxic leadership.""  NCOs who made their E-5 and saw to it that none of the junior enlisted did the same.  They fudged PT tests and terrorized their junior enlisted, simply because they could.  I believe in our military and in our fighting men but conditions in the rear are drastically, and negatively, impacting mission readiness.  How can we be expected to go on active duty and run with the big dogs of regular army when everything we have done as reservists borders on a joke?

That you would free up funds to get us the equipment that we desperately need to ""train as we fight.""  That you would implement regulations that thoroughly evaluate soldiers, not just when they became NCOs, but as they remain NCOs to ensure that good leaders are rewarded for their service, and toxic ones are punished, just the same as junior enlisted are.  I really see the reserves as a modern and powerful fighting force, but we could be so much more if we could do more practical and flexible training, AT\'s to do more than just train but actually do our jobs, etc.  Thanks for your time sir.

There, you told the students that you would make it easier to get Pell Grants, and that more federal aid would be available should you get reelected.  You also stated how Mr. Romney was trying to cut aid to students.  My question is this: Why would I want more federal money?  I don\'t want the federal loans I have now, but the system as it stands nearly forces me to have them if I want to be able to attend college.\n\nI don\'t want grants and scholarships to be more easily available, I want regulation on the schools.  It\'s a terrible, vicious cycle that is, to be blunt, screwing the students.  The schools get together and ask themselves ""How much can we squeeze out of the students this year?""  They come up with a number, and the banks and private institutions go ""Well crap, now the students will need more money.  I guess we\'ll just have to make bigger loans"".  Then the Federal Government comes in and adds MORE money to the mix, allowing the schools to charge even more.  It\'s a cycle with no end in sight without somebody stepping in and doing something about it.\n\nThere has been plenty of talk on Capital Hill about ""for profit"" schools; The University of Pheonix, DeVry University, to name a few.  You want to know who the real ""for profit"" schools are?  Harvard, Yale, MIT, Ohio State.  The schools who charge upwards of $20,000 per quarter for no other reason than that they can.  They know that the students and their parents can\'t afford it, but they don\'t care because they know that between private loans and the Federal Aid program, they\'ll get the money they want.  I just got out of Wright State University, and with only the help of a private loan and Federal Loans to get me through due to my family having little to no money, after two years, I\'m already sitting at over $35,000 in debt, and that\'s just to private loans.  $35,000 in two years.  I\'m not even 21 yet for God\'s sake!

I also am heavily involved in politics, and run an organization that hosts events where paid speakers talk about issues of the day.  Earlier this year, our organization invited Drug Policy legal expert, Alex Kreit, to come talk about Marijuana and the Law.  I asked him the question that you are attempting to ask President Obama.  I will now paraphrase what he told us:\n\nObama does not have the amount of control over local federal authorities that your questions presupposes.  Obama *did* promise that he wouldn\'t interfere with individual state decisions on medical use of cannabis.  In fact, after being elected, his administration (specifically, Eric Holder, I believe) published the Ogden Memo (Google it).  This memo basically directed local federal authorities to respect the states with medical marijuana laws, and not prosecute anyone as long as they are not in violation of the state medical marijuana laws.  *However*, local federal authorities ignored the Ogden memo, and there was not much the Obama administration could do about it.  The way Alex Kreit put it was to say there are not many ""levers to pull"" for the Obama administration, and that the positions that the local federal authorities hold (U.S. Attorneys, for example) were specifically designed so as to maintain independence from central control.\n\nBasically, as a result of all this, it\'s not really accurate to blame Obama for the fact that local federal authorities are shutting down dispensaries and arresting people.', ""As a secondary point, what role do you think states' rights (surrounding drug legalization) will play in the rest of your presidency?

Just wanted to clarify that my comments were specifically about the ability of the Obama admin to try to encourage compliance with the Ogden memo.  Rob Mikos has published a fairly thorough <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1768127"">law review article</a> that discusses this issue and explains why the Ogden memo did not really provide any protection. \n\nThat said, it is also important to recognize that Obama could have done other things on this issue but hasn\'t.  For example, Obama could have picked better appointees--particularly to head the DEA.  He chose extremist drug warrior and Bush holdover Michele Leonhart for the job.  As some may remember, this summer Leonhart refused to admit that heroin and crack are more dangerous than marijuana.  Obama certainly could have made a better pick for the position.  He could have asked prospective nominees point-blank if they would honor the Ogden memo.  Instead, by nominating Leonhart, he all but guaranteed that the Ogden memo would be ignored by the DEA.  I think that the willingness of US Attorneys to ignore the Ogden memo also speaks poorly to them as appointees.  I think a fair US Attorney would have tried to honor Ogden\'s memo in good faith, even if he or she wasn\'t obligated to follow it.  Clearly, many of them simply ignored it.  Obama\'s administration could also have supported one or more of the congressional proposals to protect state medical marijuana laws.  To my knowledge, they\'ve done nothing to back these proposals.  The list could go on.  \n\nSo, are President Obama and Eric Holder spearheading a coordinated strategy against medical marijuana?  I don\'t think there\'s any evidence of that.  I believe people who think otherwise may not have a full understanding of the relationship between the DOJ in DC and local federal law enforcement (again, Rob Mikos discusses this relationship in his excellent article.)  My best guess is that Holder genuinely hoped people would comply with the Ogden memo.  I imagine that Obama himself has probably given this issue hardly any attention (certainly he seems to do everything he can to avoid talking or thinking about this issue based on the lengths he goes to to ignore drug policy questions in public forums.)  But, are Obama appointees like Michele Leonhart and local US Attorneys cracking down on medical marijuana?  Obviously they are.  And, if Obama had nominated people who agreed with the Ogden memo in the first place, then there would never have been an issue about compelling compliance with it.    \n\nAnyway, those are only brief thoughts--it\'s impossible to convey all the nuances in an internet comments thread.  :)  But, I figured I would chime in to clarify the referenced comments of mine a bit.

At top law schools (here I’m referring to the T14 - the 14 schools that stay at the top of the *U.S. News* rankings and occasionally change spots with one another), you are provided with statistics and testimonials to suggest that, whereas you might be taking an unjustified risk if you go to a lower-ranked school, there are always lots of options for the “cream of the crop” – i.e., everyone who goes to a T14 school.\n\nMy class enrolled in August 2008, when we had absolutely no reason to expect that the promising hiring data which induced us to attend law school might become irrelevant within a matter of months.  BigLaw (i.e., the tier of the largest, best-paying, most prestigious firms) more or less collapsed during our first semester.  Although the wider legal market might have been “oversaturated” even then, prior to mid-fall 2008, students at top law schools were explicitly told that there would be no dearth of high-paying entry level jobs. The only people who should worry, we were told, were those guys at the tier 4 schools. We were told that everyone who didn’t take a high-paying job upon graduation did so out of a desire to work in the public interest. This made sense; given that even those who planned to go into the private sector had to submit application essays about how we wanted to use our degrees to improve the world, you had to figure at least a handful of students were willing to forego a big paycheck in order to do work that they cared deeply about. When my class started to worry about how we would be affected by the onset of the recession, the schools continuously assured us that we would be “fine.” For a substantial percentage of the class of 2011, this has not proven true.\n\nI don\'t have quite as much sympathy for the classes that enrolled in 2009 and beyond, when there was clear evidence that things had changed, although you have to keep in mind that these enrollees were often being led over the cliff by assurances from very reputable schools that probably didn’t have a full grasp on the direness of the situation. None of the schools seemed willing to come to terms with how quickly the value of a degree could plummet, and even now there is a somewhat deluded mindset from school administrators (assuming they aren’t flat-out lying to keep themselves afloat). Courts have historically shown little sympathy for disappointed graduates who attempt to sue even tier 4 schools that have obviously misled enrollees about job prospects, so the administrators of top schools are essentially undeterred from continuing to misrepresent how their recent graduates are faring in the world, provided *U.S. News* doesn’t take them to task for their shady efforts to manipulate hiring data (e.g., temporarily hiring graduates to work in the school library so they can list them as “employed 9 months after graduation"").

We share your view that NASA is a driver of innovation and economic growth, a creator of high-skilled and high-paying jobs, and a force for inspiration in the American people -- especially our youth. That\'s why President Obama has set NASA on course for a new and exciting chapter of American space exploration, one that will see more discoveries, scientific breakthroughs, and, ultimately, more Americans in space going to places never before visited.\n\nEven in the face of tough fiscal challenges, the President\'s plan charts a path towards continued American leadership in space by making every penny count. By investing in American companies -- and American ingenuity -- we are spurring free-market competition to give taxpayers more bang for the buck, while enabling NASA to do what it does best -- reach for the heavens.\n\nJust this past month, an historic -- and audacious -- event took place. For the first time, a privately owned American spacecraft launched and docked with the International Space Station (ISS) to deliver the cargo American astronauts need to do their jobs in space. This fundamentally new way of doing business for NASA includes partnering with innovative U.S. companies like SpaceX to embrace the efficiency, ingenuity, and resources of the private sector while allowing NASA to focus on challenges only its world-class scientists and engineers have the ability to tackle -- like sending humans beyond low Earth orbit for the first time in 40 years, outside the Earth-Moon system for the first time in history, and ultimately to explore Mars within the next couple of decades.\n\nNASA and space are so important to our future that we do need to be doubling and tripling what we can accomplish in this domain. That\'s why the President\'s plan for NASA more than doubles the number of U.S. rockets capable of going to the ISS. And the James Webb Space Telescope, which the President\'s Budget keeps on track for launch later this decade, won\'t just double Hubble\'s capabilities, but will be 100 times more powerful. This summer, Americans in a control room in California will be monitoring as an automobile-sized rover is lowered onto the Martian surface from a sky-crane hovering in the rusty atmosphere. The ""Curiosity"" Mars rover isn\'t just double the size of any previous rover -- but is also carrying 10 times the mass of scientific instruments as America\'s Opportunity rover currently operating on the surface. And with NASA\'s Kepler telescope currently in space, the number of planets identified as orbiting distant stars in other Solar Systems has not just been doubled, but multiplied several times over.\n\nThe Administration has worked with Congress over the last three years to develop a forward-leaning trajectory for NASA that places the agency on a more stable fiscal footing -- in part by joining forces with the private sector -- while still pushing the boundaries of inspiration and discovery. The key features of this plan include:\n\n* Extending operations of the ISS -- which has been continuously crewed since 2000 -- until at least 2020 (when President Obama came into office, it was scheduled to be decommissioned after 2015);\n* Acquiring crew and cargo transportation services to the ISS from U.S. commercial companies;\n* Pursuing new technology investments, like advanced in-space propulsion, to expand the reach, affordability, and potential of our space science and exploration efforts -- technologies that are required to send humans beyond the Moon;\n* Building the biggest, most powerful rocket ever -- set to be more powerful than the Saturn V vehicle that carried American astronauts to the Moon -- and cutting-edge crew capsule for deep space human exploration, including a mission to visit an asteroid in the 2020s and eventually Mars;\n* Leading the world in Earth and space science research vital to understanding our planetary home and unlocking the mysteries of our Solar System and the Universe.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone is supportive of this ambitious effort. Rather than making bold, targeted investments in our space future and embarking on new partnerships with the private sector to ensure every taxpayer dollar is spent wisely, the proposed Republican House budget plan, if spread evenly, would significantly cut NASA\'s budget, forcing the deepest cuts to the space program since just after we landed on the Moon.\n\nEven in today\'s tight fiscal environment, the Administration has proposed a NASA budget for FY 2013 that spares the agency from such cuts and yet will deliver more than ever from this essential driver of American innovation.\n\nThank you for signing this petition and showing interest in our Nation\'s space program -- an interest key to sustaining support for programs at NASA and one we could not share more strongly. We encourage you to continue demanding more from our most creative science and technology agencies, and to appreciate that it is not just about how many dollars are spent on such lofty missions, but how effectively that money is spent to deliver results for the American people. We think NASA has never been stronger.', 'So might you be suggesting, just maybe, that funding science and the advancement of civilization may be more important than dumping trillions of dollars into killing each other?', ""I agree- American NEEDS a dare to be great moment, and they're ripe for the picking.

The point you bring up is an extremely good one, and absolutely must he addressed in a very clear way for people to have faith in this sort of system, but fortunately that work was done by those who went before us. \n\nNow, I'm not a political science if civics expert so I don't claim to know what all of the solutions which have been tried are, not which were more successful. I can say that the one system I know of for publicly funded elections involves a sort of primary system but not (as primaries would also have to be publicly funded else the bribery would just happen there). It essentially is that (to use a small example of a gubernatorial race) a candidate would have to prove that they have a significant amount of support in whatever jurisdiction they are running (in my example a state) to justify getting public monies. So for example there is an election to be held in North Dakota for governor and there are 15 people who wish to run. These people, by whatever deadline happens to be chosen, would be required to gather 5% of the voting populations signatures (% can be adjusted however the citizens choose) from each district in the jurisdiction, in this case 5% from each county in ND. Now that is the voting population, so it is 5% of the total number of voters in the previous governors election (even if there are 5 million citizens but only 500,000 voted, they would only need 25,000 signatures). This demonstrates that there is enough citizen support for that person to be a serious candidate without setting the bar so high that only the major parties can clear it. \n\nNow that works in state and local elections, because the total number of signatures and amount if ground is limited so no huge sum if money must be spent to gather the signatures. But it wouldn't work for presidential elections because it would still cost many 10's of millions to get that many signatures from every state in the nation. So on that I don't know specifically what a national system may look like, I do know they exist in most countries but I haven't read enough to know the details. "", 'Here, [borrow our legislation and rules](http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/guidance/programme-guidance/ppbrules/).\n\nIn short, in the UK political advertising is illegal. Instead, in return for having part of the public airwaves given to them under license, as part of that license they must agree to air 5-minute long party political broadcasts now and again.\n\nThere is a small flaw in this, in that who gets allocated air time is based primarily on previous election results, but even the smaller and more bizarre parties can [get air time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=438UKM1Av1g) if at least some people vote for them.\n\nUK politics has its money issues, but a general election costs considerably less here per capita than it does in the US, and we have relatively little negative campaigning. That\'s also helped by the fact we don\'t adhere to a strict calendar of elections either - overall it\'s a *much* calmer process.\n\nRight now there are plans for all parties to be funded by the taxpayer based on previous election results, so a new party only needs to be ""seed funded"" in essence - if it\'s popular, it will get public money. I don\'t like the idea as it props up political parties rather than independently minded politicians who want to represent their constituencies better, but it\'s a model being discussed.\n\nSo, you know, there are ways to do this everywhere.', 'Right, we better just keep it to two...

I understand that your time is important, so whenever you feel strongly enough about an issue to reach out, I will certainly treat your thoughts with the utmost consideration.\n\nThe internet has been a game-changer that has driven innovation and brought our world closer together. As you know, in 2015, the FCC voted to reclassify the internet as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Earlier this year, the Commission voted in favor of advancing Chairman Pai's “Restoring Internet Freedom Proposal”, which would reverse the 2015 decision. Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal represents a return to the bipartisan light-touch regulatory framework implemented in 1996 by the Clinton Administration under which America's internet economy boomed.\n\nThe debate over net neutrality has gone back and forth for many years and I have long been concerned about rules and regulations that limit the open marketplace of the internet. More often than not, public policy and federal regulation fail to keep up with the advancements in technology that constantly change how we live and do business. To restrict access or hinder innovation would be counterproductive, as we live in a world today that is increasingly shaped by our interactions over the internet. The internet as an open access, untaxed, uncensored resource continues to expand our economy and add quality jobs for Americans. \n\nThere are certainly a wide range of opinions when it comes to the FCC’s proposal. These include strong views held by industry professionals, businesses, and individuals who use the internet every day. As Congress carefully examines the FCC’s proposal and actions, I will be sure to keep your thoughts in mind.\n\nI always enjoy hearing from my constituents, and I really appreciate your message. If you would like to receive periodic updates on some of the many issues facing our country, please sign up for my e-newsletter on my website or follow my Twitter and Facebook accounts. Please keep in touch – I count on people like you to be my extra set of eyes and ears in the 2nd Congressional District.\n\nSincerely, \n \nGeorge Holding \nMember of Congress"", 'I called my rep’s office (Sean Duffy WI district 7) and they said Congress has nothing to do with the FCC.

IMO, the only reason reddit is such an echo chamber on this issue is that people have been making a fuss about it for years, spreading propaganda to make people believe that the internet as we know it will be gone forever if NN went away.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe internet is, by its very nature, decentralized. It\'s only become centralized because big interests saw the potential early on and invested in the infrastructure and then took steps working with regulators to keep out competition, which is why we now have only a handful of national providers.\n\nBut with decentralized internet technology that is coming, such as IPFS, we soon will be able to be our own internet providers on an *individual* level. The idea that we even need companies to provide internet access for businesses and consumers is soon going to go the way of the dinosaur. This will make the whole NN debate completely moot.\n\nThe problem I see is that people think the way it is now is how it\'s always going to be, and that appeals to government are the only way to fight centralization. But if the problem is too much centralization, why do people think appealing to the most central authority figure is going to remedy that problem? It\'s backwards thinking on so many levels. These same people would probably be celebrating in the streets if the government just decided to take control of the industry and be the only service provider nationwide. Hey, who wouldn\'t want free internet access for all? (That\'s how they would sell it to the public.)\n\nThat is, until they find out that the same government providing everyone with internet access is also monitoring everything they do online and using that information to manipulate and control the population. That, I think, is the ultimate goal. NN is being forced down our throats as a means to get the public on board with more government control of the internet.

In America, ISP's are few and far in between. Over the years, smaller ISP's have been gobbled up and only a few big players remain. These big ISP's dominate certain areas and for the most part, act as a monopoly or an oligarchy. This is bad for the consumer. Over the years, these ISP's have lobbied for laws that only benefit themselves. In many areas, cities can not even offer municipal internet because they wrote laws, on behalf of these ISP's, that prevent themselves from doing it. They have also written laws that prevent other ISP's from moving in and offering services, because to do so, would mean they would have to share the pipes...which would be so costly and not even remotely feasible.\n\n\nNet Neutrality, is one counter, to the many threats facing a free and open internet. In short, ISP's are not allowed to favor traffic over other traffic. All traffic must be treated the same. Why does this matter?\n\n\nWell the issue really comes down to this. For example: Comcast owns part of Hulu. Comcast, being driven by revenue, would want more people to use Hulu vs Netflix. So without Net Neutrality, Comcast would have a couple options, both of which would be bad for consumers. They could either throttle the speed of Netflix, making Hulu seem like a better option, and forcing people to buy their content...or they could charge Netflix an excessive amount to not throttle their traffic. This of course would trickle down to the consumer, through higher costs for subscriptions. In either case, the consumer gets screwed.\n\n\nNet Neutrality is a protection for consumers. It protects the right of people to have an open internet, where all traffic is treated equally. With how much is shared over the internet, and have access to many great sites that foster learning and growth. If you now have to pay extra, to use Wiki for example, for those who can't afford the price increase, all of a sudden, we have people who has limited access to educational materials that allow them to learn. Do you really want to allow ISP's to be able to price people out of being able to access certain sites and certain data?\n\n\nYes, Net Neutrality may not be the end all be all but it is one of the few things we have left that can help protect the consumer, and the citizens from having a restricted and overpriced internet. DO NOT GIVE ISPS THIS POWER!\n\n\nMy last point is this: lets says you want to research Net Neutrality and understand the complexities of it. Living in a world without Net Neutrality, you may have to pay extra to gain access to sites that would help you understand the issue. You would literally have ISP's being able to block content such as political views and issues behind a paywall. AMERICANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE INFORMED!

"", 'Q: how much dick do you suck?', '(A lot of people upset about censorship and such.  Let\'s see how this does...)\n\nPeople keep saying that the firing had nothing to do with the preceding, [horrible Jesse Jackson AMA that was ever so celebrated by conservatives](http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/07/02/reddit-revolt-flares-again-as-ama-moderator-sacked-the-day-after-a-disastrous-jesse-jackson-qa/). However, I\'m really not so sure.\n\n**Either way, I say let the AMA mods and admins BURN...**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdVUncJzCm0\n\n**Yeah, this was the top-voted AMA question for Jesse Jackson the day before**: (emphasis mine)\n\n> Mr. Jackson,\n> **You are an immoral, hate-filled race baiter** that has figured out how to manipulate the political system for your own gain. You\'ve personally set back race relations year after year and continue to do more harm than good. Extorting money from companies to line your pockets and threatening to bus in protestors and create a fake racial controversy if they don’t agree to pay you off is NOT civil rights activism. My question is simple; **how is your relationship with the illegitimate child you fathered in 1998 while cheating on your wife? Bonus question: How much money have you extorted from various people and companies over the years of practicing your shakedown scheme? Do you think Al Capone would be jealous of your business model if he were still alive?**\n\nThat Jesse Jackson AMA didn\'t surprise me and it\'s very telling who is doing the brigading and who is not on Reddit.  It\'s obvious that, for the most part, conservatives and/or racists are brigading the shit out of AMAs while progressives are mostly trying to play fair.  Reminds me of all the scummy Republican gerrymandering that\'s going on in voting districts around this nation.\n\nAnyway, as soon as I saw Jackson\'s AMA pop up, I figured Stormfront and all the other racist scumbags of the Internet would upvote brigade the hell out of attacks (in the form of questions) like they\'ve obviously done with so many other racially charged topics, comments and AMA ""questions"" here in the past on Reddit.\n\nI think it\'s fair to say that the AMAs on Reddit are very broken and incredibly susceptible to inequitable brigading --- and I think it\'s a damn shame nothing had been done to mitigate it.  Or, if there has been anything done, it sure as hell was a miserable effort that resulted in failure.\n\nThe powerful (and/or perhaps the conniving and corrupt) have a hefty advantage over those who may attempt to play fair and/or are powerless to drum up social media support for their own AMAs.\n\nMike Rowe\'s last AMA received nothing but fawning, softball questions floated to the top despite his very public and controversial libertarian viewpoints.  I expected at least a few challenging questions, but nope.  Fortunately for Rowe, there aren\'t a bunch of progressives that organize at off-site forums to brigade attacks against him.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who didn\'t pander to Rowe had their questions downvoted into oblivion and went unanswered (of course).  It was a great public relations vehicle for Mike Rowe and not much more.\n\nIt was probably very helpful that Mike Rowe (and/or his handlers) knew to stir up his base by letting all his fans on Facebook, Twitter, etc. know well in advance that he was going to be on the AMA beforehand --- and he specifically asked his fans to come and ask questions via his social media accounts.\n\nIf I did that for my little post here, I\'d be banned for brigading.  **Why is that practice OK for AMAs, then?**\n\nGranted, people of all political stripes have done what Mike Rowe did and promote their AMA beforehand, but I find it *interesting* how often those with a conservative viewpoint get a pass while those with a progressive slant get slaughtered with massively upvoted attacks in the form of questions.\n\nWith all that in mind...\n\nWhat about those who do an AMA that may not think it\'s ethical to promote softball questions by stirring up a social media fan brigade beforehand?  Is it fair that they get bombarded with vile attacks rocketed to the top of their AMA?\n\nHow about people who aren\'t social media savvy enough to know how to stir up a fan brigade before their AMA?  Why should they get subjected to attacks while someone like Mike Rowe, for example, gets a pass?\n\nOr, more importantly, how about people that aren\'t powerful or popular enough (or unethical enough) to brigade their own AMA, but have powerful adversaries that do?\n\nA civil rights activist that\'s not well-known will get bombarded by top-voted attacks (in the form of questions) by a hostile brigade, for example.  The activist just says screw it and leaves the AMA disheartened.  I\'ve seen similar to this happen multiple times.  This Jackson AMA was just a lot more high profile.\n\nI\'ve seen Reddit AMAs go bad for good people.  Meanwhile, I\'ve seen AMAs act as fantastic public relations for those that know how to game the system.\n\nI don\'t pretend to know whose fault at Reddit the shitty AMA situation is, but I have to say I\'m happy to see attention being brought to the problem.\n\nI\'ve despised that sub for a long time now and I resent the people who\'ve worked at that sub who enabled (or sat complacently) while obvious brigading made it a great place for scumbags to pretend to represent all of Reddit and shout down good people that simply asked the public to field them some questions.\n\n*How to fix AMAs?*\n\n**I think the AMAs should be restructured to have new and single-purpose accounts to have less voting power than older, established accounts.**  Or, even better... no voting allowed at all from single-purpose accounts, etc.\n\nI would also love to see AMAs have transparent voting so we can all see **who** is voting up ~~questions~~ attacks like ""You are an immoral, hate-filled race baiter..."", etc.  Let\'s see how ""grassroots"" that kind of upvoting **really** is.\n\nLet everyone (new accounts and old) ask questions in AMAs, but don\'t allow an influx of new and single-purpose accounts with very few comments to skew the voting on Reddit AMAs and artificially promote ~~questions~~ attacks that are meant to cause nothing but harm and push ulterior motives instead of enlightenment.\n\nKind of strange that progressives organically upvote a lot of content on Reddit yet they don’t seem to be able to stop the massive tide of upvotes for attack questions on Reddit AMAs against Jesse Jackson, for example.\n\nSeems strange that we keep seeing time and time again where racially charged topics that attempt to put minorities in a bad light get a sudden, massive inflow of votes on Reddit.\n\nPerhaps the people who brigade like this have played their hand too many times now and people are starting to notice?\n\nIt’s just a bit of history repeating...\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg_Patriots\n\nThey helped to kill discourse on Digg and made it a vile place. Digg responded by changing their format in stupid ways instead of getting to the source of the problem ...and the rest was history.\n\nSomewhat related:\n\nhttp://discourse-cdn.global.ssl.fastly.net/boingboing/uploads/default/original/3X/6/a/6af222293c0f66e5d4c296db2a7a1800a5e1e836.png', '1.

3,FCC just voted to kill Net Neutrality. Now we will SUE THEM and FIGHT in Congress! We are Free Press & friends. AMA,"The FCC just voted to throw out the Net Neutrality protections. Now cable and phone companies are free to block, slow down, or charge for fast lanes for content on the internet. This vote was a complete disregard for public opinion, facts and the law itself.

Google might get all the permits to do the work, but Google can't access the poles or conduit themselves. They need Comcast. And that went about as well as you would expect.

After watching the live stream, it was evident who was for a dollar and who was for the citizens of this country. It was spot on how the two women chairmen  (I forget their names, please forgive) almost tore the house down in opposition, saying everything we all thought. \n\nThey said the last year and the current they have hit their cap of four-hundred million dollars, while actions of the FCC\'s vote are in question; in the longer term the financial usage that led to those caps should be put into investigation as well. While people can\'t afford 900 dollar pills because they have a disability that they could not help; the chopping block has programs of the health of the people square in its sights but not something as suspect as this? The night before, various large companies put out updates that say ""speed and optimization"".\n\nSpecifically calling out Facebook for putting adds on video\'s that have no skip but promote ISP\'s, at the same point Google announced a wireless program that basically was crafted specifically around NN going away, a plan that would take more than short time to plan and implement while both were noticeably silent on the issue. Not to mention, the places ISP\'s own that are news outlets had little to no coverage at all about a vote that changes everything.\n\nDespite all of this, and despite the FCC being an independent sect of government; multiple officials were denied entry even through the door, two million stolen identities confirmed before the vote even happened, over twenty-four million comments, letters, and outcrys with and estimated 83% favor of keeping Title 2, all of this was neither entered as fact nor even a concern save for the only two representing the people in the room who voted no and jokes about language and comment from Sir Spud about looking like a ""potato"" and retorts from the benefactor in-cheif about ads and promoted tweets already happening.\n\nFirst, that\'s offensive; a potato has more substance and is a food many people like. Second, if the ads were running and promoted tweets were against the rules of Net Neutrality; you should probably resign as this admission was a direct statement claiming knowledge of misconduct from companies in public view without any punishment or investigation by the head of the FCC himself. Knowledge of an act against a department of government\'s law without action seems like a crime right? It is. Just to be clear, it is. Also, if any donations or money or even a half eaten donut were taken as a bribe and at least three were involved, it\'s not only a crime of accepting a bribe but technically a federal conspiracy to commit a crime. It\'s called a RICO Conspiracy and all can be charged the same (thank you The Dark Knight for this. It\'s bad when a movie is more factual than the FCC). \n\nFurthermore, even if they believed in the vote, the country that gives them power is a Democratic nation. If, a government branch of the United States (even if elected to make decisions), makes a decision while publicly ignoring the majority or the public at all for that matter, this would be an act against the people of the country. It\'s true, it\'s what we founded the country on in the first place. Remember learning about the Boston Tea Party in grade school? It\'s fortunate because history is almost not being considered worth teaching in schools yet those same schools require Internet connection for students who are issued laptop\'s that are mandatory. Today, the Tea is taxed and tainted so much that we have to dump it into the harbor and ask how the Tea keeps ending up in this harbor!\n\nNow despite my own concerns about utilities like water, electrical power, or... say, the INTERNET; there is no question that the Internet is now no longer a convenience, it\'s a part of everyday life that makes it essential to function. We pretty much made this set in stone when we started giving four year olds Iphones and made it more normal to facetime with your neighbor while playing GTA instead of going outside and like... doing... play. No, slides and swingsets are more obsolete than what the kid on multiplayer say\'s he\'s made your mom. We might stomp that little newb into a k/d so low that they throw their controller into a tv, but like it or not, it\'s how we are evolving. Technology, is the glassware we use to hydrate; the Internet is almost water. That we drink. To live. UTILITY.\n\nIt\'s the day after the vote to take away something that has become a part of us and put a fee inside a hidden fee on it. The Senate is next, after that it will already be violent because the changes will start stacking and the people won\'t even vote. It\'ll be 88 mph all the way to the steps that lead to a nation. This why history is so important, we learn from our mistakes, we use what we learn to avoid more mistakes, we grow and in the process try not to start actually battles over something that brings people together like the Internet should.\n\nIf you skipped or made it this far, I fully support the overturn of the vote yesterday and pursue criminal action for infringement upon our civil liberties, rights that founded this very nation.', 'What can I say to my representatives to convince them to fight for Net Neutrality?

If you look at cable television or cellular service providers, for example, these industries have been revolutionized because of a push towards pay-for-use models.  Companies like Netflix, T-Mobile, and Sling TV have found success specifically because they've flown in the face of the old one-price-for-all formula, and instead began offering consumers the optionality to pay only for what they needed and used.  The fundamental idea driving this is that those users towards the bottom of the usage pool essentially subsidized the costs of the users with the highest usage.  The innovation towards the a la carte business model has led to lower costs, greater optionality, and an increased number of offerings for consumers.  Why, then, wouldn't we want to do the same for the internet?  It is a fact that the United States, on average, has among the lowest speeds and highest prices in the world.

We only find great grievance in the evidence that Bernie had GINORMOUS turnout for speaking engagements whereas there was no coverage for Hillary. \n\nNow in the same sense, Ajit Pai has done the same thing, although, I fear, far more grave in nature and with far less support (truly, less than a fraction of a percent so very likely support such a repeal). \n\nThis abdication of duty of the president or whomever is responsible for FCC board management is a serious offense, at least of impeachment or resignation.\n\nIn great sense, I agree with you that when the people voice their opinion and the official acts differently, they shall be removed from office. \n\nThe cornerstone of this government is that the people have a direct say in electing each official and the constitution dictates such. The interference of any foreign state in such an affair to directly affect the outcome is an explicit act of war. Aside from that, the serious issue with current American politics is not even really the lack of participation in just voting, but for strong-willed citizens to integrate themselves directly into the political arena by running themselves for office, which in my opinion, is the pinnacle of our government. Insofar, we see career oligarchs or established politicians keeping a stronghold in office. When they effectively do their job and the people expressively recognize that in voting, that is fine; yet, too often, when you find yourself at the poll, you have a very limited choice between two candidates you\'d rather not choose among whom both are known to abuse their power (not just president, but your local offices as well such as the prosecutor, sheriff, or mayor). A new blood is needed to emerge and take reign. An idealist. Somebody who can\'t be bought off or swayed and influenced into the established routine of operation. When that idealist works on behalf of the common people, actively measuring and gauging their responses and directly representing the people based specifically on those responses, you have a democracy. We are too numb to assimilate the painful fact that what we have is not a democracy, but an oligarchy. \n\nThe prosperity of Europe is achieved by the plain fact that they most recently suffered the hell of dictators and totalitarians that they cherish their new found ability to vote in an election for individuals they want. It is why you will see multi-million people rally uprising when such egregious and unsupported rulings are made or actions taken vs solely online bickering in US affairs. Where are the people taking actual action against such apparent tyrants? There is a clear complacency problem in America and that will continue to increase the disparity of the classes and welfare of the essential middle class people who run the economy. \n\nThere is a clear instability when the foundation of such economy is based actually in China, India, and third-world countries who do all the critical manufacturing of common goods. What sense is there for common class individuals then? They are to be pitted against another for survival because their worth is less due to competition (supply and demand of human labor). Their best means of survival will come from living ""off-the-grid"", essentially governing themselves. There are clear fractures and fragments in the structure of the United States to the effect that it will crumble along those lines with the poor to middle class individuals forming a new government among themselves. \n\nThus, it is enough to say that the people will always have the power.

The AGs can’t even cite the APA correctly (“Procedure” is not plural). How is this different from interest groups urging the writing of form letters to an agency making identical points, most of which are disregarded by agency staff anyway? (The agency need only consider a significant point, not its redundant iterations.)\n\n> For one, it’s not a popularity contest. See, e.g., U.S. Cellular Corp. v. FCC, 254 F.3d 78, 87 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (an agency “has no obligation to take the approach advocated by the largest number of commenters” and “may adopt a course endorsed by no commenter.”). For two, the APA “has never been interpreted to require the agency to respond to every comment, or to analyse every issue or alternative raised by the comments, no matter how insubstantial.” Thompson v. Clark, 741 F.2d 401, 408 (D.C. Cir. 1984); see also Vermont Yankee (“administrative proceedings should not be a game or a forum to engage in unjustified obstructionism by making cryptic and obscure reference to matters that ‘ought to be’ considered and then, after failing to do more to bring the matter to the agency’s attention, seeking to have that agency determination vacated on the ground that the agency failed to consider matters ‘forcefully presented.’”).\n\n> Here, the AGs point to comment spam, but then don’t elaborate on how they are material to the validity of the proposed rule. They don’t even articulate a theory! Sure sounds to me like cryptic obstruction of the Vermont Yankee variety.\n\nWhile this comment is pointed at halting/pausing the vote on the repeal due to the allegedly fraudulent comments, the cited case law (as well as precedential case law such as Citizen's United) does make a compelling argument in favor of the FCC. And, as an engineer, given the standard of arbitrary and capricious, it seems like the FCC has provided enough information to jump that incredibly low hurdle. So while I think it's the wrong outcome, the law does seem to indicate that the FCC will win.\n\nLong story short, I would like to know how you all are planning to respond to those rules and arguments and what other legal theories/arguments you are planning on posing.\n\nThanks!"", ""Howso?\n\nMy only understanding of the matter is that the FCC enacted Title 2, so why can't they unilaterally get rid of it?"", ""And beyond starters?

Lobbying would outsource this task and allow experts in the field to be able to give the most expert opinion on the matter, the thought being if experts on both sides gave their take on the argument an informed opinion can be reached.

The concerns about technical ability, I understand, so even on that basis alone I perhaps understand why it would be desirable for the FCC to preside.

Consider Acts 4:42-47 which is the beginnings of the early Church after the death and resurrection of Christ: \n\n“They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. 43 Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. 44 All the believers were together and had everything in common. 45 They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. 46 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, 47 praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.”\n\nNow, specifically look at 44 and 45....believers selling property and possessions to fund ministries to ANYONE, not just Christians, in need. This is what the church(the worldwide collective body of Christians) is supposed to do...unfortunately many modern mainline churches are more concerned with building bigger buildings and having the best websites, social media, music, etc. rather than actually doing the work that Christ modeled and called us to do. \n\nSo I’m sorry for whomever gave you the misconception that pastors, churches, etc. exist for their own selfish gain.

The church is SUPPOSED to be the vehicle in which ministry is done and programs that help others are operated out of. Unfortunately, like many things, this is not always the case.

I’m just a normal guy, who spends his free time with his hot wife and cat in St. Louis. I didn’t see any of this coming, it’s been a crazy week.

(our assignment was to rant about something we're passionate about) What do you think? Here it is:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKen Bone: Our Deliverance From Evil\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs the ever-deepening morass of modern American politics grows ever more bizarrely phantasmagoric, as we descend farther and farther into madness and hysteria, logic becomes foreign, truth becomes elusive, the absurd becomes normal. It should come as little surprise, then, that the American public remembered nothing of the second presidential debate - not the preposterous prevarications, not the vitriolic vilifications, not anything of that turbulent tempest - they remembered nothing other than a portly and mild-mannered man from Illinois, clad in a quaint and charming red sweater, brightly curious about energy policy.\n\nThe American people, already nearly devoid of hope, could viscerally feel their last vestiges of optimism being painfully crushed from their souls as they watched two people, one of whom will soon become perhaps the most powerful human being on Earth, hurl invective at each other, talk over one another and the moderators, evade inquiry of any sort, obfuscate rather than clarify their positions. Donald J. Trump, that grotesque, corn silk-haired love child of a toad and an Oompa-Loompa, even went so far as to threaten his opponent.\n\nSo, once again, it should come as little surprise that America, seeking some ray of hope amid the ghastly cataclysm of this debate unfolding before their terrified eyes, focused in one the one glimmering point of light that shone through the darkness: Ken Bone.\n\nKenneth Dean Bone: the Internet’s darling, and a true American hero. Like others before him, he stood, he spoke, he sat, and that was all. But there was something special about Ken Bone; something about his kindly face, spectacled and mustachioed, something about his stylish red sweater, something about the innocence of his manner as he rose and asked the candidates his question, something that spoke to the American people. Ken Bone spoke of energy policy, but the American people heard this: I am a good man, a man worthy of your love. In an election season filled with the scurrilous lies and unbridled hatred of serpentine politicians, here was a man America felt it could admire. And so, Ken Bone was catapulted to instant Internet fame.\n\nAmerica can feel the walls closing in. Terrorist threats, racial tensions, an environmental catastrophe that threatens to destroy us all: the free world needs a hero to pluck us from the brink of the abyss. But no such hero has yet appeared. The rapacious and foul-mouthed Donald Trump versus the hypocritical and duplicitous Hillary Clinton; neither seems nearly fit for the task. So when a friendly-looking and, frankly, adorable red-sweatered man by the name of Ken Bone rises to ask a question about energy policy with - is that a glimmer of joy? Or, at the very least, the absence of utter resignation? His affect shocks us. Ken Bone seems as if he was teleported to us from an alternate reality, in which the world is a safe and good place, where those in positions of power are sensible and moral, in which an upstanding American citizen might proudly and cheerfully do his civic duty, attending political debates and asking questions. Ken seems to have hope; thus his aura of innocence. For who but the most innocent, the most pure, who could have hope in a world such as ours? America wants to share in his hope - it wants to believe in Ken Bone. Ken immediately comes across as warm, affectionate, optimistic, and candid, qualities as rare as unicorns in today’s political landscape. “Ken Bone Is the Only Honest Man in This Election,” proclaims Esquire magazine. Truly, this righteous man was the one bastion of virtue amid the hideous depravity of the second presidential debate, and has been recognized as such by the hundreds of thousands who have flocked to him and what he stands for. Even his name is suggestive of that innocence, honesty, and optimism that he has come to stand for. Ken Bone. Say it: Ken Bone. Who could fail to adore a man by the name of Ken Bone? Truly, say this humble hero’s followers, as long as there are Ken Bones in this world, all is not lost. To which I say: Ken Bone for president.\n"", 'What led to you asking about the environment?

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\n\n>Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\n\n>There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine\'s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called ""Linux"" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.\n\nOn the other hand, Linus Torvalds himself has stated his preference for Linux:\n>Well, I think it\'s justified, but it\'s justified if you actually make a GNU distribution of Linux ... the same way that I think that ""Red Hat Linux"" is fine, or ""SuSE Linux"" or ""Debian Linux"", because if you actually make your own distribution of Linux, you get to name the thing, but calling Linux in general ""GNU Linux"" I think is just ridiculous.\n\nWhat is your view?

5,"I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Ask Me Anything.","I’m excited to be back for my seventh AMA. I’ve learned a lot from the Reddit community over the past year (check out this fascinating [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/adxzo7/what_areas_of_robotics_research_are_you_most/) on robotics research), and I can’t wait to answer your questions.

If you’re wondering what I’ve been up to (besides waiting in line for hamburgers), I recently [wrote](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2018?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) about what I learned at work last year.

Melinda and I also just [published](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) our 11th Annual Letter. We wrote about nine things that have surprised us and inspired us to take action.

One of those surprises, for example, is that Africa is the youngest continent. Here is an [infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/aulqu1/africa_is_the_youngest_continent/) I made to explain what I mean.

**Proof:** [https://](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)[reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant\_wait\_to\_kick\_off\_my\_seventh\_ama/](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)

**Edit:** I have to sign-off soon, but I’d love to answer a few more questions about energy innovation and climate change. If you post your questions [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auosel/ask_me_about_energy_innovation_and_climate_change/), I’ll answer as many as I can later on.

We don't just compete domestically anymore, but world-wide. I think there's probably some validity to that too.\n\nSome say the suit against Microsoft itself paved the way for other tech companies, Google among them, by allowing an opening in a monopolized market. By that logic the market dominance of the big 3-4 tech companies now may be keeping down newer ideas. This ties into net neutrality, too.\n\nSo I'm asking what's your opinion on these laws and anti-trust in general. Are they unneeded, outdated, or still relevant? And you may be somewhat biased of course, but what is your opinion all these years later of the MS anti-trust suit and its consequences?\n\nEdit: [A wikipedia entry on the ruling and the companies the judge felt had been harmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.#Judgment)\n\nThanks for an answer.

As a former American Red Cross volunteer and US Army OIF veteran I sometimes find myself craving to be part of something larger than myself but when I look into opportunities I’m often conflicted. Like Right now I’m in Chiang Mai and I found the Free Burma Rangers here thanks to Reddit. It’s an organization that sends volunteers into war zones to assist civilians. Except it turns out there are very few of these humanitarian deployments and they are extremely short (I didn’t think it was ideal but it’s a skill set I have and I want to make a difference). The correspondence I had with the organization definitely made it feel like displaying their churches and spreading their religion was more important than the actual humanitarian missions. I personally feel much better giving food to homeless people than donating to charities at this point. I want to know my money is going to people in need without burdening them. It feels wrong to push an agenda while providing help. People are intelligent and inquisitive. If they want to learn more about why you do what you do that’s fine but I’m not the type of person that feel like I have to force my beliefs on others. Sorry for rambling but you’re know as one of the most charitable people on this planet. Do you often worry about similar conditions? Personally I’d love to just have my own small charity so I could afford to help people in need on a more consistent basis for no reason other than to see the good in humanity and brighten peoples days. I can see why it’s so important to you and I envy that you get to make such an positive impact on people on a regular basis.\n\n\nAlso there are tons of other charities in Asia but a huge portion of them require you not only to support yourself, but also pay fees to volunteer.

I wish to provide a life story and progress. \n\nI was raised in a household that still suffers today, teetering on homelessness, while in the past I’ve been homeless sleeping in a car or at a classmates house and attending school.  With my family and so much drama and violence, only to now get out of the years of physical abuse from one of my siblings that imprinted probably a permanent severe flinch problem that you could trigger just by raising your hand to quick or too high to grab the salt shaker at the dinner table, I have years of abuse of verbal amoral destruction and toxicity amongst my family that I myself conquered through consulting my parents as an adult so that I can prevent anymore to burden me or any other members. From the physical and verbal abuse I  now suffer from an extremely crippling anxiety disorder that causes almost heart attack like symptoms at the thought of any confrontational or financial or just productive socializing with new people in general. It poses a big threat on my future health as I’m prone to heart related problems from the constant high blood pressure I get daily. And physically I have sciatica and a sketchy hip problem from being slammed by my unnamed sibling, which Impedes my current hobby and first priority career I do not plan to disclose. Besides that I’m almost underweight for my size because I barely want to eat as adrenaline sits in my body too long, and I evacuate anything in my system (scared shitless really can be a valid description) so I it causes digestion and nutritional problems for me.\n\nI could never find a job up until I got a medical card after being referred by a psychiatrist in managing my anxiety. The anxiety blocked off my ability to manage my life, then I began to take legal by the state dispensary medical cannabis and it improved my life greatly.\n\nI could go outside feeling motivated, confident and feeling good. When my anxiety caused me to avoid advancing my life it became a source of depression because I’d go no where.\n\nMy hip and sciatica have become damn near invisible and I could freely work my interests as they’re physically demanding. \n\nI got into college finally because of my worry as my family of honest immigrant workers, subconsciously I’d avoid the thought of having to shell out money even though I was set anyways to being a first generation college student, as my parents either dropped out or couldn’t go to school and were raised at home in their respective countries, so  financially this could contributed to my avoidance, but it gave me the confidence to speak to my own family about working through all the taxes and planning to get my life in track, I even pursued a job in the county and soon the auto industry on the side as a career. Now pretty soon I’ll be supporting my community by keeping them safe in my county job! \n\nNow after years of abuse poverty and isolation from some more specific personal things that happened in my life, I feel like I could be the one in my family to bring it out of poverty and make my family name mean more than just a poor immigrant family down the street in a bad neighborhood. \n\nPlease help our Americans who suffer from severe mental and physical health that shouldn’t be dependent on anti depressants and opioids that could become addictive and create a even bigger and corroded cavity in someone’s life. \n\nThank you.\n\n', ""What's with Bill Gates creepy obsession with vaccines and population control?\n\nIf he's so worried about over-population, why doesn't he start with himself? "", ""Is it possible to be an Honorary Recipient of the Gates Millennium Scholarship?\n\nI graduated from John Muir High School, Pasadena, CA in 2011. During my senior year, I had applied for the Gates Millennium Scholarship. I completed all ten of the required essays and asked 2 teachers to recommend me, Mr. Pete Newlove (my English teacher for 3 years) and Ms. Saxton (Graphic Design teacher for 1 year). I had trusted both teachers to turn in their respective parts of the application on time, however, Ms. Saxton ended up mailing hers in a day after the deadline. I'm not sure how accurate this is, but during this time, I remember reading on the website that if any part of the application was submitted late, everything would be discarded. This greatly upset me as I had worked very diligently on my parts of the application, and I know Mr. Nelove did as well. \nDuring this time, I was in foster care, I had been placed at the age of 15 after years of enduring abuse, neglect, trauma, and poverty at the hands of my maternal, biological side of the family, and was newly diagnosed with PTSD. However, despite all of the turmoil and adversity of my childhood, I was able to develop resilience and maintain a 3.89 GPA and rank number 4 out of 200 of my classmates. I graduated with honors, attended UCLA, pursued my B.A. in Gender Studies, and graduated from there in 2015. Afterwards, I went on to further my education even more by acquiring my M.A. in Marriage and Family Therapy from Pacific Oaks College, with a 4.0 GPA, and I didn't stop there. Now, I am currently pursuing my Psy.D. in the same field from The Chicago School of Professional Psychology (downtown LA campus), and I am looking forward to becoming licensed in the next few years as well as earning this degree and using it to teach graduate level courses. In the future, I wish to provide therapy to underprivileged, marginalized groups, including former foster, kinship, adopted, and institutionalized youth, as well as young adults that suffer from mood, thought, anxiety, and/or personality disorders, those who belong to the LGBTQ+ spectrum, and under-served racial/ethnic groups. I am also currently in the process of writing and publishing a collection of poetry, my autobiography, and other novels, as some of my work can be seen on my website: CheatedOutofChildhood.com\n\nIn addition, I have written educational/informative blog posts surrounding the topics of Mental Health and Feminism that can be found on Thought Catalog, and the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) websites.\n\nIn my spare time, I also currently serve as a volunteer facilitator for the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, a peer-run support group held multiple times per week. I love giving back to the communities I belong to.\n\nAs you can see, I have big dreams for my future. But I could use more help. I went to UCLA virtually for free, since I won many scholarships and grants because of my independent status and work ethic/determination. However, though I have won a few scholarships and grants during my graduate years, I have still accumulated over $180K in debt, and it will be closer to $250K by the time I finish my Psy.D. The Gates Millennium Scholarship would have really helped me pay for these degrees and not have any remaining debt. I feel that I deserve a chance to still receive one as it was not fair one of my designated teachers did not do her part, and I am excelling despite the odds. Only 2-3% of former foster youth go on to college, and a minuscule fraction of that percentage go on to pursue graduate degrees. I am happy to say that I am within that tiny portion and I hope to pave the way for others.\n\nIf needed, I am still in contact with Mr. Newlove, I'm sure he would love to serve as a recommender again. And I am also in touch with my other Graphic Design teacher, Mr. Steven Ramirez. He was the one who initially inspired me to apply for the Gates Millennium Scholarship, and one of my biggest regrets is not having asked him to recommend me rather than Ms. Saxton, as I truly believe that she is the sole reason I am not a recipient. I can also provide you with my transcripts and financial aid award letters for verification.\n\nPlease, I know that the Gates Millennium Scholarship no longer exists, but I feel that I have a right to at least ask that I be recognized and perhaps receive some financial compensation to help reimburse me for the loans I have spent on my graduate degrees. I am proud of my accomplishments and wish to use them to advocate for others, but I am still in need of help and support. Though I have achieved huge academic feats, I still struggle with paying for rent, bills, groceries, and basic necessities.\n\nPlease, re-consider me.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this message.

Please hear me out.\r\n\r\nYou are trying to maximize the good you can do for the world. Your foundation saved, and is saving, countless lives in the poorest places on the planet. This if fantastic work. However while you were saving lives in Africa, things on the home front have deteriorated. America is no longer the beacon of hope it used to be. I came to this country many years ago from a place ruled by a dictator. It is still ruled by a dictator, but if I still lived there, would I move to the USA today? Not so sure. \r\n\r\nThe States are divided. More divided than they've been any time in the last fifty years. Republicans and Democrats used to be able to work together. They used to come up with hard compromise solutions that nobody was particularly happy about, but everyone could live with. Not anymore. Now it's just about whoever is shouting the loudest. If we look at history, this is similar to 1930s Germany &ndash; they too had communists and fascists fighting it out, often in the streets, with no dialogue between factions. We all know what happened next.\r\n\r\nThis country needs a leader that can unite its people, or things will only escalate until blood is spilled. We need someone who can talk to both sides. Someone  who doesn't blame the other, but works with the other. I believe this person is you. You have a sterling reputation, something that nearly every politician lacks. You are a moderate, that is what the country needs now. You might be the only moderate actually electable. And you don't care about power, you don't actually want to be President, which makes you a better candidate than anyone who does.\r\n\r\nMr. Gates, this country needs someone like you to carry this burden. If you want to achieve the maximum good in the world, uniting this nation may be, at this time, more important than your foundation's health programs. Would you consider sacrificing 4 years of your life to try and do it? Yes, it will be terrible. The critics will assault you everywhere you go. You will be attacked by populists both from the Left and the Right. But you will have a chance to restore this country to what it ought to be &ndash; the UNITED states.

My fiancée and I have been watching your scientology show quite closely and love it so much because your experience of your belief system falling apart and your escape from that cult programming parallels my own experience so very much.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I was born into a Mormon family of 4 kids. We were all raised and programmed to believe all the basic and advanced principles of the Mormon church and its history. I always struggled with faith and several times in my adolescence fell away from the church. In the end the beliefs that had been pounded into my character won out and I decided out of guilt and fear to serve a two year, full time, mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I was “endowed” and “set apart” as an ambassador of Christ and direct representative of the church. I was sent to the MTC (Missionary Training Center) in Provo Utah for 9 weeks where I was essentially trained and brainwashed into a recruiter for the church, learning the proper techniques to lure people into the folds of the church.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I was sent to the Rome, Italy mission where I struggled with depression and melancholy for almost two years before I finally had enough.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That isn’t to say there wasn’t happiness… there was… and if you read my journals from the time you will see that. But over time the dirty actions the church was willing to take to keep missionaries within church standard and recruit people disgusted me enough that I began to question that basic tenants of the church. I was able to smuggle an iPod touch into the field and my second apartment happened to have a free wifi signal. I connected with the community at\xa0exmormon.org\xa0and they helped me to find the truth and the courage I needed to question everything I had ever believed and takes the steps to breaking free.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The church caught on to my use of the iPod and called me back to the mission home in Rome where they could keep me under closer watch. Finally, we got a new mission president and he decided to make me a trainer. This was the opportunity I needed to draw farther away from the church until the night I decided to leave and literally had to enlist a complete strangers help to escape on a subway from two missionaries tasked to follow and watch me.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I escaped out of Rome before I was informed that the church instructed the Italian government to cancel my Visa and issued an instruction to have me arrested and brought back to the church. I came back voluntarily before this could happen. I demanded to go home, but instead the president held me and forced me to watch the semi-annual general conference in hope that the “spirit” would prompt me to stay. It didn’t, and I didn’t.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My shelf fell and since then I have been obsessed with finding out every bit of information on the Mormon church I can. I feel like a psychopath… but people do not understand how devastating it is to be raised believing something… relying on something… and then to hear that it is all just bullshit. I wish it had all just been true. Like you, I did not want to find out everything I had believed me entire life was a lie.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0My parents are still in it, unlike scientology there is not a policy of disconnection. We don’t have it quite as bad as you do. Some Mormons voluntarily disconnect, but most don’t. I’m very lucky because though we have a strained relationship, at least there is one.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything that you are doing for people like you and I who are victims of these organizations.

Then the person would ask if they could feel their touch, once the injured person responded the assisted would move closer to the injury, once they got to like the ankle or so, they would go back up the leg, then repeat the progress back to the injury. Supposedly after working all the way to the injured toe and back a few times the injury would be healed.

It's supposed to have a vault containing the archives of Hubbard on high tech discs. Do you know anything about this at all?"", ""Dear Ms. Remini\n\nI just want to say I'm very very proud of you for what you're doing to stop now only Scientology but other cults including the Sun Myung Moon. My mother was a Christian Scientist until the day she died. Christian Science  founded by  Mary Baker Eddy in Boston Massachusetts They did not believe and going to doctors only prayer to heal them. They had a choice either go to a doctor or prayer not both. My mom died of endometrial cancer she was at stage 4 and she realized she had it when she was in denial and in shock and my father and I took care of her along with the hospice nurses at a local Hospital in my hometown and it was a very good and a reputable one. One of the top hospitals  in the county  kind of like Cedars Sinai  and UCLA . I remember hearing her on the phone with an old girlfriend she hasn't talked to and 40 years as I was going up upstairs hearing that she was crying to her old girlfriend said yes I have cancer. and it breaks my heart because she finally had a wake-up call knowing that her life was short. According to Christian Science prayers or medicine and doctors not both was just a few things that Mary Baker Eddy had shown people to follow that kind of faith. I remember going to a Wednesday night reading and the woman sitting in front of me is taking a prescription pills during the service which puzzled me. My mom as I was growing up but struggled with schizophrenia and she was the comatose schizophrenic. She would try and get off her meds and rely on God to heal her because that's what Christian Science has taught her. And seeing you Leah, that you're exposing Scientology for who they are and I'm so proud of you very very very very very proud of you that's just the tip of the iceberg. My prayers are with you and Mike to go forward and expose Scientology for what they are and I hope to live to the day I see when Scientology is demolished and is  no more. I recently moved from my town to the Los Angeles area for change and I have a wonderful man that is close by which we both love each other very much so I'm going to school and working part time. I wish I could meet you Ms Remini and give you a great big hug. I had when I was getting off my work in Studio City where I work I had a woman approach me in the restroom while I was washing my hands and it was near closing time she approached me and ask me personal questions about my life and I told her about me leaving my hometown to move to Los Angeles for a better life and much happier here. She tried to get me to try a Dianetics she asked me if I've heard of it and I said I may have I'll look into it she asked me if I wanted to join her I said I'll think about it and have to get going and I left the rest room that night going to my car thinking to myself why does Dianetics sound so familiar and when I went to bed it dawned on me that it's the same as Scientology she tried to convert me try to coax me to come to the church. But thank God she lost the battle she's not going to take me to the Church of Scientology. About 5 years ago prior to me moving to Los Angeles I came up here for a job I filled out an application. I noticed online I forgot what website that was but I used my boyfriend's address cuz he insisted I do so to help me gain employment here to be closer to him. And when I received some of my mail from him I noticed I got postcards regarding the entertainment destroy coming to seminars to work in the entertainment industry which who could resist that right? The dream come true. But when I read the fine print I noticed it was l.ron Hubbard in the fine print. It creeps me out about this so-called religion. It is not ! I still have those postcards to this day I would love to show them to you. I get choked up watching your show I'm so glad God bless you two exposing Scientology for what it is. you and Mike and all these other people God bless you all. I'm so glad I never signed up for Scientology I know it's a cold I see it a note from a long time ago but I'm doing my own little research way before I even knew you were an actress. but I thought it was kind of Bazaar when I did see what time Kama it was during the eighties in the nineties. thank God the thought came to me that was a cold it was something I should stay far away from. And I thank God I never joined Scientology. keep up the good work Leah and Mike and all of you band together as well and become one to stop this ASAP.\nIf you answer my email I want to meet you and Mike privately and not share my email of meeting with you so we can get together and show you my postcards about the Scientology preys on the innocent.\n Looking forward to hearing from you.\nCal"", 'I was enthralled by your series on Scientology.

Thank you so much for doing the show and telling the truth about what you and countless others have experienced. I am so sorry and heartbroken for everyone\'s pain because of this religion/cult.

She was my mom's closest friend in the 90's, up until she went into the church of Scn and left her friends and husband behind. I loved Mary Lee. She was sweet, genuine, and funny. She was a great story teller with her big Southern twang. I didn't give a damn who her son was. Sure, it was intriguing, but she had a heart of gold and was the most Real of all my parents many friends. My mom, a devout Catholic, talked to her about the Catholic Church (of which, I'm no longer affiliated), and Mary Lee decided to join it. It was just my parents and the Souths there for her Baptism (circa 1995?). Mom knew that she could always talk to Mary Lee about anything and whatever was discussed never leaked to anyone else. My dad's health started to drastically decline around 2001, so I moved in with them in their MN home until a year after his death. That was the same time that mom heard less and less from her. All of their Marco Island friends knew that she just abandoned her marriage and Tom got her into Scn. Everyone was pretty heartbroken, but none more than Jack. The last time mom spoke to Mary Lee was a few years ago. Everyone asks about her - is she healthy? Is she alive? My mom turns 90 on February 15, and we are throwing a party for her on Marco Island. I think that's why she's been on my mind so much lately. Is there any way that I can get word about her well being back to my mom? \n\nOn another note, I love you and Mike. I just finished watching your first season of The Aftermath. Episode 5 nearly wrecked me. The Headley's story was frightening and tragic, but they are clearly heroes, along with all of you who were oppressed and escaped. Hearing about the propaganda that the little man complex D-bag Miscarriage spewed was disgraceful. When are picketers going to march outside that punk's mansion that Scn coffers built? I'd love to help make signs that claim that little punk is a child molester, like they did with others... Sorry, I just had to get angry for a minute. I believe in karma. \n\nPlease contact me if you know if Mary Lee South (Mapother) is alive and cared for - or if you have any information. Thank you! Good for you!

It was only when Isaac Hayes, who at one point got all over David Miscavige and said, “Why are you not reaching out to my people?”, did Scientology buy a building in Inglewood and one in Harlem and say, “We’re putting a church there.” They’re not full of people from the local community, believe me. Subsequent to that, over the last, I guess it’s five or seven years or so, there has been a concerted effort by the Church to engage and involve the Nation of Islam in Scientology. Now, where this is going and how this is going to end up, I don’t really understand because you cannot be a anything and a scientologist. You are a scientologist and that’s it. In fact, when the IRS was asking Scientology questions, they responded with an answer that is very revealing. Ultimately, you may not be a scientologist and practice another faith. You cannot be both. \n', 'Steven Hassan -  In my understanding, the cult identity is programmed to be dependent and obedient and follow the rules.

When you’re a lawyer standing up in court, you can point to that stuff as legitimate legal authorities and commentary on this kind of behavior, so I think it is a little different than most of these other groups. \n\nSteven - And all the other groups would love celebrities, but no group has had celebrity centers before.\n\nLawrence - I think that was a stroke of genius on Hubbard’s part because he saw that there’s one thing that Americans really do worship and that is celebrity. And that’s the reason he set his church here in Los Angeles and that’s the reason the celebrity center is just down the street. It’s all geared and celebrities are like athletes on Wheaties boxes for the Church.

The first book that was written was called ‘Dianetics’ and after that was a book called ‘Science of Survival.’ In the books that every scientologist has to read, there is a chart of human evaluation. Basically, what it does is it teaches you who to look out for in your life. There’s numbers connected to this chart and below a certain number on this chart is the most degraded, aberrated person that you could ever know. That classification is called 1.1, and that is where L. Ron Hubbard wrote homosexuality lives in that band. That is the sexual pervert. That is the person who needs so much help, but not really a person worth trying to help.\n\nMike - Right. I mean truthfully, Scientology has two positions on homosexuality. One, the public position, which is “Well, we don’t take a position.” Internally and for scientologists, the position is there is something very wrong with it. Deviant behavior that needs to be dealt with with Scientology. \n\nLeah - Meaning, as a person gets to the upper levels of Scientology, the “gayness” will be audited out.

The latter has/had a guy in charge who was always kind to me, and I believe he had been a merchant marine at one point.  All of the engineers, cabin cleaners, handymen, deckhands were under him.  At one point when I was put on manual labor, I did work in the engine room for a bit, specifically cleaning scavenger spaces, which they consider one of the worst jobs (and why I was given it - I was in trouble).  I also, at one point, had to help clean and paint bilges.  It was pretty bad too, but after we were done, I often daydreamed about hiding out down there.\n\nWe\'d did have watches!  Members in both orgs were assigned to watches.  Generally, a schedule was put up a few hours before we were underway and we\'d just look for our watch team on the schedule.  A watch was two hours if I recall correctly.  We mostly sailed overnight so I had a lot of watches from like 2am-4am etc.  Everyone on a watch specialized, sometimes in more than one thing.  You\'d train under someone who was more experienced and we also had courses we\'d complete to get ""certified"".  I was a ""certified"" lookout, and was training to be a helmsman.  Some of my best memories are pulling into port at like 6 in the morning when the sun is just coming up and the air is cool, and I could watch the deck crew tie on the ship.  Underways were rarely over 8 hours, but sometimes if we were going to a new set of islands, they\'d be a couple of days.  We\'d generally stay within a close group of islands, like Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao for a few weeks, and then move to a new group.\n\nI lived in basically a dorm room with bunks and lockers.  I had five other roommates.  Obviously it was really small.  Some other crew members lived in nicer rooms with maybe only one to three other people, and they had bigger storage space and curtains on their bunks.  I just never got moved into one of those rooms.  Communal showers were down the hall and we were supposed to shower in 30 seconds or less, but unless there was a wait, it wasn\'t strictly enforced.  Bathrooms were in the hall too.\n\nWe ate in a cafeteria.  Generally the food was pretty good - lots of fresh fruit and a variety of food to choose from, but there were definitely times when we were told that the org didn\'t have enough money and we were put on beans and rice.  At the time, I thought it made sense since maybe the ship was only at a quarter capacity or something, but now that I\'m out and I\'m aware of how the senior management live, it makes me so angry - such hypocrites.\n\nOK, so a typical morning for us, would be muster on the top deck, then we would a morning chore that we were assigned prior.  Mine was cleaning one of the public bathrooms.  Then we had another muster and would do ship drills.  Sometimes it would be lifeboat drills where we would lower and raise the lifeboats. I was an engineer for those, which basically just meant I started the engine.  Sometimes it would be teaming up with a partner and taking turns making our way up from our bunk on our hands and knees and blindfolded.  Sometimes it would be a two minute drill, where we would go to our bunks and the drill would sound and we\'d have to be up at our emergency stations within two minutes. \n\nAfter ship drills, we would have 30 minutes to shower and get dressed and be on post (at our job), which started at 9 am.  I\'d work until 6:30 and then go study Scientology courses in the course room until 9, and then usually go work a bit more.  I tended to get off of work around midnight most nights.  Sometimes I wouldn\'t study for weeks on end, so I\'d be working from 9 AM until Midnight seven days a week.  It just depended.  \n\nThis has gotten really long, I realize so I\'ll end it there, but feel free to ask any other questions.

Furthermore, people who have HSV-1 and HSV-2 are over 3x as likely to contract HIV. Currently, the regulatory nature of the FDA has created such high barriers to entry that only the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical players would be able to push through a vaccine (the approval process costs 100+M). However, with a 4B+ annual market in a drug called Valtrex (which only handles outbreaks but does not prevent transmission), the large players are not incentivized to create a cure or vaccine for HSV-1/HSV-2. Instead, they have been pushing subunit vaccines (viruses that are so heavily attenuated that the body is unable to produce a long lasting immune response; these failed trials centered around the same failed approach maintain their profits in drugs that keep those who suffer at bay rather than giving them a lifelong solution). Billions of people carry HSV-1/HSV-2 and tens of millions suffer from lifelong outbreaks. \n\nThe company that the therapeutic/preventative vaccine is being tested under is called Rational Vaccines. They have recently conducted Phase 1 trials internationally and have seen profound results in the mitigation of symptoms in people with extreme cases of HSV-2.\n\nUltimately, a live attenuated HIV vaccine will likely be the path to eradication of the disease. This was the method employed for the polio and chickenpox vaccines. However, the attenuation of the polio, smallpox, chickenpox vaccines was random rather than by design, making it risky if the virus reverted to its original form..this resulted in the infection of 1 in ~100,000 vaccine recipients, but this was because the virus was attenuated in one site and would, in rare case, mutate back to its oringal Wild type form. My father's approach attenuates the HSV-1/HSV-2 viruses in multiple locations while still leaving it 99.7% intact. Since it is attenuated in multiple locations the odds of the virus reverting to its dangerous form are 1 in 100,000^3, meaning that practically no one who received his vaccine would be infected. The risk pales in comparison to the millions of people who contract HSV-1 and HSV-2 every year.\n\nSo Bill, is there a way that you could look into my father's work and help guide progress in the clinical trials/approval of the vaccine?

However, my unemployment is now up and I have yet to land a new position. Now I have barely any income on my part (I am married) and a 3 year old son to take care of. The nanny position I took while I am job searching in my field barely pays anything. Do you think it is possible that something could/will be done about the extensions? ', ""Hi Bernie,\n\nI gleefully voted for you and strongly believe in your platform. However here in the Bay Area you have, a few times now, endorsed candidates for state office who strongly oppose policies to bring in new high density housing construction. (Specifically Jane Kim and Jovanka Beckles). Job growth has occurred rapidly here but construction of new housing has failed to meet that burden, and the result has been rapidly increasing rents and housing costs, with disastrous results for the working class.\n\nWith your endorsements, you've aligned yourself with candidates who support policies that will exacerbate this scarcity.\n\nWhat is your position on urban housing development, and its role in housing affordability in areas with rapid job growth? Do you support higher residential density in urban areas with low carbon emissions and good public transit? Or should America continue its pattern of suburban sprawl and accompanying auto emissions and habitat loss? If you do support higher density, how do you reconcile that with your endorsements?"", 'Hello Senator Sanders,\n\nI was a huge supporter of yours in 2016 in my home state of Washington. I caucused for you, donated, and spread your message to all willing to listen. I was fortunate enough to attend your rally at the UW campus that year. It was magnificent!\n\nOne of the major reasons I supported you, apart from the obvious stuff (Medicare For All, Decriminalizing Cannabis, reigning in Corporate powers), was the fact that you largely have avoided pushing excessive gun control in your home state of Vermont.\n\nAs a racial minority who genuinely isn\'t sure whether or not I can trust Law Enforcement to protect me, I strongly believe in the Second Amendment, as well as the ownership of commonly owned rifles. I know ""assault weapons"" are a highly contentious point of political conflict, but I would hope that, as a nation, we could discuss the ramifications of reactionary gun laws and the unintended consequences they may have on the American people.\n\nAs you yourself witnessed during the Civil Rights Era, our laws tend to disproportionately impact specific groups, namely racial minorities and the poor. While I do greatly wish to see action taken to reduce gun violence, I have a hard time imagining how criminalizing the ownership of 50+ year old rifles will improve the already divisive nature of our country. Just like our drug laws, new gun laws will impact racial minorities and the poor before it affects those who *truly are* a threat to community safety.\n\nMy question is this: **What can I do, as a left-leaning liberal gun owner, to better highlight my concerns to a Politician willing to listen?** I\'ve sent countless emails and letters to my local representatives, only to be brushed off as an ""NRA Supporter"" or something similar. I despise the NRA for a variety of reasons, and I\'m not here to represent their misguided attempts at being true representatives of the American Rifleman. I want a serious dialogue with serious people who are willing to treat this issue with the respect it deserves.\n\nGun ownership is a right that belongs to ALL American people, and I fear that the polarity on this issue will result in further division when we *should* be coming together.\n\nThanks for the AMA!', 'What can we do to prevent climate change from killing humanity?', ""Senator,\n\nActive duty military members can usually only vote via absentee ballots.

I have deep respect for you and even sat in the Senate gallery to watch you speak my first time in DC. Your work for working class and low-income individuals is renown. \n\nWith that being said, I want to hear your views on a couple issues that I feel that you have misinformed. The first is: I want to know your reply to the argument that a national $15 minimum wage will increase the unemployment rate in economic regions where the equilibrium wage is below $15. More specifically, I want to know how you would combat unemployment due to small businesses, a large part of the suburban and rural American economy, not being able to cover labor costs? \n\nThe second question I have for you is related to my past work in public housing. In many urban areas, there have been calls for rent controls or even limiting the boundaries of urban development to make housing affordable for those with low incomes. However, the result of this policy can lead to slumlords  and blight since the upkeep of an apartment/house above the rent control is not profitable.

Seeing as we are constantly told there is no money for fixing our infrastructure, but we are paying tremendous taxes and many politicians have substantial salaries.

It was definitely obvious in the rise of Trump but I fear it is equally present in the backlash on the the other side of the proverbial fence. No doubt the removal of Trump from office is a step forward for the evolution of civilisation given the direction it has been progressing throughout recent history. Do you think, however, a step forward is somewhat less of a victory for civilization\'s progress if it too is driven by the same human tendency for sensationalism or popular trend that enabled Trump to take office in the first place? At what point do we as a people need to step back and figure out why we as so susceptible to getting caught up in the tide of popular opinion in our own demographic? is it simply our nature to follow the herd or do you think we, in collective scenarios, can overcome the tendency and exercise real individual discretion to a point where we are no longer susceptible to social, cultural and all other forms of mass manipulation or conditioning? We saw the same thing after 9-11 even I found my younger self supporting the reaction to the attacks, I dare say if it didn\'t last so long it is possible I may not have become weary enough to question what now seems like an obvious knee jerk, action-reaction response.\n\n\n2) With wealth distribution becoming ever more biased and polarised, in addition to the environment and the ecosystems that sustain our very existence, being exchanged to the point of near collapse facilitating the generation of said wealth. Do you think we should be concerned that those who plunder for profit are fully aware of the repercussions and simply do not perceive a threat because the wealth they have hoarded will likely insulate them from the catastrophe that awaits around the corner especially for the poorest of humanity.\n\n3rd and finale, do you think as I do that education is of prime importance for real evolution for our global society?

But I think it is important that we understand that what we are seeing now in the world is the rise of a new authoritarian axis.\n\n>While the leaders who make up this axis may differ in some respects, they share key attributes: intolerance toward ethnic and religious minorities, hostility toward democratic norms, antagonism toward a free press, constant paranoia about foreign plots, and a belief that the leaders of government should be able use their positions of power to serve their own selfish financial interests.\n\n>Interestingly, many of these leaders are also deeply connected to a network of multi-billionaire oligarchs who see the world as their economic plaything.\n\n>Those of us who believe in democracy, who believe that a government must be accountable to its people and not the other way around, must understand the scope of this challenge if we are to confront it effectively. We need to counter oligarchic authoritarianism with a strong global progressive movement that speaks to the needs of working people, that recognizes that many of the problems we are faced with are the product of a failed status quo. We need a movement that unites people all over the world who don’t just seek to return to a romanticized past, a past that did not work for so many, but who strive for something better.\n\n>While this authoritarian trend certainly did not begin with Donald Trump, there’s no question that other authoritarian leaders around the world have drawn inspiration from the fact that the president of the world’s oldest and most powerful democracy is shattering democratic norms, is viciously attack an independent media and an independent judiciary, and is scapegoating the weakest and most vulnerable members of our society.  \n\n-Bernie, [Oct 9^th '18](https://medium.com/@SenSanders/building-a-global-democratic-movement-to-counter-authoritarianism-46832e3beef6)"", '# YUGE', '[Universal vote by mail](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/janfeb-2016/vote-from-home-save-your-country/) and [same day voter registration](https://www.demos.org/publication/what-same-day-registration-where-it-available) have been found to boost youth turnout.

', 'Ethnic homogeneity. It is a lot easier to convince people to give money to people who are like them. Diversity lowers social trust and the enthusiasm for income redistribution. Particularly when you already have a government known for mediocrity due to affirmative action.\n\nHarvard political scientist Robert Putnam -- famous for ""Bowling Alone,"" his 2000 book on declining civic engagement has found that the greater the diversity in a community, the fewer people vote and the less they volunteer, the less they give to charity and work on community projects. In the most diverse communities, neighbors trust one another about half as much as they do in the most homogenous settings. The study, the largest ever on civic engagement in America, found that virtually all measures of civic health are lower in more diverse settings.\n\nThe greater the diversity the greater the distrust, says Putnam. In racially and ethnically mixed communities, not only do people not trust strangers, they do not even trust their own kind. They withdraw into themselves, they support community activity less, they vote less.\n\n""People living in ethnically diverse settings appear to \'hunker down,\' that is, to pull in like a turtle,"" writes Putnam.\n\nThey tend to ""withdraw even from close friends, to expect the worst from their community and its leaders, to volunteer less, give less to charity and work on community projects less often, to register to vote less, to agitate for social reform more but have less faith they can actually make a difference, and to huddle unhappily in front of the television.""\n\nThe overall findings may be jarring during a time when it\'s become commonplace to sing the praises of diverse communities, but researchers in the field say they shouldn\'t be.In a recent study, **Glaeser and colleague Alberto Alesina demonstrated that roughly half the difference in social welfare spending between the US and Europe Europe spends far more can be attributed to the greater ethnic diversity of the US population**\n\nhttp://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/\n\n\nThe Swedish bureaucracy is much more efficient and the population is much more homogenous than in the US.

This is something foreigners rarely understand. They think that our big government makes the country run well, whereas it is the other way around—the fact that it works well makes it possible to have a big government. If countries don\'t already have a tradition of an efficient, non-corrupt bureaucracy with an impressive work ethic a larger government only means more abuse of power and more waste of money.
