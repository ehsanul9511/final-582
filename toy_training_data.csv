Your administration has been very quiet regarding Americans' issues with the TSA and their invasive security procedures. Your administration even [pulled](http://www.infowars.com/white-house-pulls-down-tsa-petition/) a petition regarding making them answer a court order regarding the naked scanners.  Do you have any plans to reel in the over-reaching, rights-infringing bureaucracy the TSA has become?
Marijuana prohibition has resulted in the arrest of over 20 million Americans since 1965, countless lives ruined and hundreds of billions of tax dollars squandered and yet this policy has still failed to achieve its stated goals of lowering use rates, limiting the drug’s access, and creating safer communities.  Isn’t it time to legalize and regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol? If not, please explain why you feel that the continued criminalization of cannabis will achieve the results in the future that it has never achieved in the past?
Let's skip the marijuana legalization question that'll show up at least 50 times on this page and get to a related issue: After promising that you wouldn't interfere with individual state decisions on medical use of cannabis, how can you justify utilizing federal funds and agencies to shut down dispensaries and arrest people who are legitimately sick?
How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?
Since this is the house that kn0thing built, let me ask a tech entrepreneurial questions.  1. I just found out yesterday about the changes your administration has proposed for tax rates on C-Corps (dropping the rates to 28%).  Why isn't anybody talking about this?  I feel like this is something that you'd want to make sure to get across to folks in the entrepreneurial world!  2. Does the democratic party know how much distrust it's sown through the SOPA/PIPA efforts?  I'm a staunch liberal, and made sure to call my congress critters over this issue.  Despite the extents to which your administration has done on awesome tech issues, SOPA/PIPA hit a really sour note for folks like me.

Hi Mr Gates.  I work in health-care in South Africa and I just want to say thank you for the work that your foundation has been doing for HIV research here. Your willingness to help those who have less than you is something that I truly admire and aspire to.  My question is how do I feel like I'm doing enough? With all the pain and suffering that I see everyday, it's hard to feel like I am actually making a difference in the grand scheme of things. How do you deal with feeling like it's a never ending struggle to actually make a difference and help people?  Edit: I've noticed a lot of people giving gold and silver in this ama. Please consider donating the money instead to worthy causes. I'm sure Mr Gates would appreciate that a lot more. Thank you. And a big thank you to everyone for their kind words, I really do appreciate it.

Hey Bill! I have a question pertaining to an issue in the U.S. and it's one that we're all get sick of hearing.  Do you think social media - [and perhaps the internet in general](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/may/13/internet-confirmation-bias) - has played a role in helping divide this country?   Instead of expanding knowledge and obtaining greater understandings of the world, [many people seem to use it to](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/07/14/confirmed-echo-chambers-exist-on-social-media-but-what-can-we-do-about-them/)  1) seek and spread information - including false information - confirming their existing biases and beliefs, and  2) converse and interact only with others who share their worldview  (these are things I'm guilty of doing myself)  Follow up q: What steps should we take to help bridge this social, cultural, economic, educational and regional divide?

Why do you think our healthcare systems have such a hard time leveraging the revolutionary changes in scalability that we've seen in software?  Amazon is able to predict what we want, often before we realize we want it, but healthcare systems struggle to even schedule routine appointments and labs.

Also, any idea on what we as concerned patients and family members can help to encourage this compromise?  I just feel like we're so close to using technology to improve efficiency and thus increase accessibility to care.      Thanks for your time!

Additionally, poor understanding of science among the general population is impairing our ability to pass essential environmental legislation and provide accurate science education in schools. What will you do to improve scientific literacy in this country?
Hello Sen. Sanders,  While I understand your stance on nuclear power is (forgive me for paraphrasing) something along the lines of “old reactors are bad, why are we (as taxpayers) spending money to keep them going?”, I have not yet found any quotes from you regarding new nuclear energy technology.  Could you give some opinions on emerging nuclear technology, such as reactors with passive safety mechanisms, the ability to consume spent fuel rods from other (pressurized water) plants, and fusion?  Since nuclear power has close to the lowest amount of human deaths per kilowatt hour of electricity generated ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/2/ ) , is it fair to cut all taxpayer funding to developing newer forms of nuclear power while subsidizing others?  For the record I am hopeful that you will win in 2016 regardless of whether or not we see eye to eye on this issue.  Thank you for your time.
If you win in 2016, what will your first dispositions be?

Senator Sanders,   As a young political science student it seems many of my peers are feeling increasingly disenfranchised from politics as a whole, particularly due to increasing corporate influences in politics.  But realistically what can be achieved when these interest are so intertwined with current political campaigns and current issues? Is there a way to separate these interests within a political system that seems to depend on the very same interests?   Also is it seems many Americans have a negative knee-jerk reaction to social democracy ideals, even if they may be beneficial to our society. Do you think there is a way we can discuss these issues that can bring in more people to the conversation?  Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA senator.

Senator Sanders, thanks for your time. I hope  am not too late.  As a member of our country's armed forces I see on a daily basis a struggle for many military families. While we do receive medical/dental and other valuable benefits, we far too often see those that separate from the armed forces left hanging in limbo as it has been shown through recent VA incidents. Also, aside from that, our country, more specifically our Congress, has been unable to pass a budget thus resulting in sequestration, and that is something many active service members both here at home and abroad are affected by on a daily basis. So my questions are to you:  1. What is your plan to effectively apply better medical and mental health treatment to our veterans, both in and out of the service?   2. What can we expect from your presidency moving forward regarding the funding of our armed forces?  Thanks for your time, I hope to receive a reply!
**Why are you guys buying Senator Bernie Sanders reddit gold? Why not consider donating that few bucks to his campaign? It's far more meaningful and useful.**     Lol, smart ass gold. First time I've seen that. 
Bernie,  I feel many voters in my age bracket (18-30) will strongly support your campaign. With the exception of first-time voters, many of my peers in this age bracket feel burned by false promises and unrealistic expectations established during President Obama's campaign.   With this in mind: What, **specifically**, do you feel you can **realistically** accomplish in your first term as President that my age bracket can get excited about? You've been outspoken about supporting a $15 minimum wage, progressive tax reform, single-payer health care, and elimination of higher education tuition fees; do you feel like you have the ability to **realistically** bring one or more of these ambitions to fruition if elected president?  Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA. I look forward to supporting your campaign.
Hi Mr. Sanders,  When Obama first campaigned, he brought a lot of optimism and many voters truly believed that he had good intentions of being a different kind of politician than we had become used to. So, if you win, what will be different that will allow you to get done what is best for the country and not fall in line like other candidates?
What is the most useful thing we can do to benefit your campaign besides donating money?

Hi Bernie, hispanic college kid here, thanks so much for doing this AMA... Two quick questions!  1. Do you approve of the way the USA is handling their relationship with Latin America currently? Considering recent trade deals, the drug wars amongst other things have been hurting the region, do you think there is any way of changing the way the US relates itself to Latin America for a more mutually beneficial relationship?   2. What is your opinion on the fact that the DNC has scheduled only six debates for the primaries? Since it's important to get the issues out there and get yourself to be known by the people, do you think six debates are enough? And if not, is your team working on making sure there are more?
Senator Sanders,  I am a transgender US Army Soldier with a decade of service. A recent study revealed that there are approximately 15,500 transgender personnel currently serving in the US Military.

Does the potential for increasing our already staggering deficit concern you?"

Hi Andrew, thanks for taking our questions.  While Asian Americans are the fastest growing and fourth largest racial group today, voting turnout continues to trend at a historically low rate.

I really appreciated your mini twitter warpath yesterday against the Automation deniers - both in the media and otherwise.  Can we expect this more aggressive version of you to be out there  more ardently defending against the rampant misinformation campaigns against you from now on?
Hi Andrew,  My question involves nuclear energy, and Thorium reactors. I think it's a critical technology along the path to sustainable energy production, and I commend you for recognizing that, while all the other candidates have thrown out nuclear wholesale.  First, in your opinion, how far are we from being able to deploy and utilize Thorium reactors at a large scale across the US? Second, what is your plan for funding the development and commercialization of the technology in order to finally reach widespread adoption of the technolgy?  Thank you for your time! Wish you great luck in your campaign!
When you become president what do you do if Congress, Mitch McConnell, or whoever tries to completely stonewall the freedom dividend?
Andrew, how did you meet Zach and the rest of your early team?
Your tweet about 15 hour work weeks really resonated with me. We work too hard for too little and the profits go to the top.   In a Yang administration, will there be top-down pressure on companies to move in this direction? Or will the Freedom Dividend be enough to empower people to improve their situation?
Andrew do you have prepared lines when you go into debates and interviews for what other candidates or moderators might say to you? Or do you stick to your talking points and improvise?  Also, I have a suggestion for the election-tampering question you'll undoubtedly get asked again:  ""In addition to the hemisphere line, pivot completely and talk about how the US meddles in elections in our own country by partisan gerrymandering and purging people from voter rolls. Then you can pivot again anywhere you want depending on the flow of the interview — you can talk about democracy dollars or foreign influence of money like with the NRA or voter disenfranchisement.""

Hi Bill,  It's well established that you bring a large tote bag of books on trips and usually finish them all prior to returning home. How are you able to focus and absorb so much information, especially when (I assume) the main purpose of these trips isn't usually reading?  Is there a specific note-taking strategy you use? What exactly do you write as you're taking notes?  I've been trying to read more during the pandemic and sort of succeeding, but at times I find myself looking at words and not absorbing their content. This is partially due to ADHD, but I think learning to take notes will help.  Thank you!

Some questions Reddit users might have to Edward Snow are:,"This question is for anybody.   If you had one go-to source of information to use to convince people that mass surveillance is a problem, what would it be?
What can we do about UK's increased surveilance and monitoring of the internet? Do you think that there is a point that this might breach human rights etc...  How can we better protect ourselves against unauthorized spying on the internet; on phones etc...
For Mr Snowden. Any comment on the revelation that Intel have a co-processor on their x86/64 cpus together with a pre-emptive multi-tasking operating system - Minix OS that includes a tcp/ip network stack?  [source](http://www.zdnet.com/article/minix-intels-hidden-in-chip-operating-system/)  Such a device would, in theory, be highly capable of low-level interception and could probably even scan and hook kernel in-memory data structures. For example irq vectors for keyboard logging, or watching or writing raw ethernet/tcp-ip frames, or even kernel or app level ssl apis.    Is it known whether intelligence services use or intend to use such  capabilities? What could an average user do to defend against this kind of ring -2 hardware supervision.

Hi, Edward. Are you able to go out much these days or are you still Snowden?
Hello Edward, long time no talk.   How do you think Wikileaks has evolved as an organization over recent years?   And a softball, coming from a former kamaaina (the one who runs this reddit account): Do you miss Hawaii? 
Mr. Snowden, what is your take on Russia’s influence on the 2016 election?
I’m actually writing an essay on Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks along with the entire culture of whistleblowing right now for my high school. Any chance you could comment a random unique quote to pop in my paper and source as a personal conversation with Edward Snowden?  People are telling me to just ask a question, fingers crossed  What’s something that everyone should know to stay more anonymous and safe online?
What can we do with people that don't care about mass surveillance and use arguments like ''I have nothing to hide'' or ''I already know the NSA and companies like google or fb can read or hear through my messages and I accept it''? Thank you
Edward Snowden. Are you still in the employ of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)?
For as much as we all rant and rave about this, I feel like we're powerless.  The people we put into office keep pushing crap into legislation until they get their way (i.e. Net Neutrality) and it feels like courts are on the side of surveillance.  What can we really do to stop this kind of creep (that isn't just creating mild hiccups for surveillance agendas)?
Quick question, what the fuck is wrong with our government?
Hey Edward. You wrote software for your goverment that helps them in mass surveillance and way beyond that. Have you ever wrote software that could help people to avoid NSA? Do you think you could do that?

My question-- what experiment from Mythbusters (no matter how big or small) shocked you the most? One you were almost 100% certain would go one way and when it went the opposite you almost couldn't believe it.  Thanks for doing this!!
Hey Adam, I've loved Mythbusters ever since I was a kid, thank you for so many great shows. We all know you're a massive film fan, but how do you feel about video games? What're your favourites? 
With a last name of Savage, what were some of your childhood nicknames?

Why do you think they banned your book?
I'm two thirds of the way through World War Z at the moment and I'm loving every bit of it so seeing this AMA was a very pleasant surprise!  My question: what are your thoughts on how little action many of the world's nations have been taking in dealing with this epidemic even though, unlike the plague in the book, coronavirus has been very widely reported on. Should we not have understood this would have gone global when it infected an entire province of china with a metropolitan area of 60+ million people?
I hate to be that guy and go off subject, but do you have any more books like World War Z in pipeline? It’s one of my favorites and I would love for more of those amazing short stories. Thanks!
Loved your book, read it cover to cover.  My favorite chapter was the downed pilot who survived in the marshes talking to her, possibly fictional, guide over the radio.  My question, how accurate do you think you captured the reactions of different countries?  Are there any corrections or additions you would make?  For example, I think in light of recent events, multinational criticism and blame would be a new dimension to talk about in World War Z, although I think you went for a more optimistic ending.
What do you *really* think is happening in North Korea right now?
I loved the way you created the story on finding patient 0 and how it all unfolded during that search. Do you see any effort done by govt's even interested in initial point entry to their countries, and have you been hit up by anyone asking for help?  Loved your book. Have you read up on the lore on the dollar flu in The storyline for Tom Clancy's the Division video game? I was reading/playing that at the near exact time I was also reading WarZ and the public response, apathy were eerily similar for works of fiction..
What are the top takeaways from your books that we can use during the current pandemic? More importantly, how's your dad doing? How often do you visit him?
With the number of rising cases around the world. Do you think the full quarantine shut downs (don't leave your house) are the extreme or the right call at this point in time?  Edit: as a side note. Thank you so much for Minecraft: The Island. I am a divorced father and bonding with my son long distance was hard. Reading that book with my son really helped close that gap. So thank you.
Max, could you let us know how you feel about how Hollywood botched the movie adaptation of your fantastic book? I know it happens to many authors but I'd like your perspective.
I loved your book Max!  Any plans to take that to a smaller format like a Netflix series and get into the stories of the individuals?  I really loved the blind swordsman story myself.
Has there ever been talks to make WWZ into a miniseries on HBO or Netflix or something like that?  The book seems perfect for a miniseries or limited series format and it really deserves a better screen presentation than the movie we got.
What type of research did you do for your fictional landscapes that you feel is important to share?
Do you think a Redeker plan would be effective in a non-zombie pandemic scenario? (By that I mean the isolation tactics, the selective protection zones and the withdrawal of services from over-taxed areas to save strategically important ones?)
Aside from being a well-written, engaging, even commanding, story, this novel may be the best socio-political thing I've ever read - fiction or otherwise. I feel strongly enough about this that I am going to try to start teaching this novel in my Advanced Literature class in high school.   What was your initial motivation in writing this story, and why did the movie break my heart?
Big fan of WWZ and ZSG. Massive inspirations for my creative work.  I've always wanted a faux documentary tv adaption of WWZ. The film is fun but very different. I want to see a talking heads documentary with dramatised bits.  Has that ever come close to production? Sounds like a perfect candidate for an Amazon or Netflix mini-series.
What actions would you take, if you were the leader of a small country with few infections so far?
How do you think the response to the corona virus has been compared to the outbreak in your book?  The initial cover ups and then media frenzy and misinformation seem like I’m rereading sections of of the book. By the way World War Z is my all time favorite book!
Which country as a whole—right now—do you personally view as having best handled coronavirus among its populace?  Huge fan of WWZ! Bought it on Kindle years back but haven't read it since then. Just re-downloaded it for another read!"

I know that thanks to you,  many people have left the klan.  How many people would you say that was, and how long on average would it take them to come around after meeting you? 
Thanks for doing this AMA. I had a chance to read a little about your story and it was incredibly intriguing, because I've thought on more than one occasion about what would happen if someone like me were to attempt to change the life of a KKK member.    At the risk of sounding strange, from the time you started involving yourself with the KKK to now what would you consider to be the best experience you've had?
Hi Daryl - Thanks for doing this AMA!    Saw the doc about you recently and wondering in particular what your thoughts are now how you handled the interview with the Baltimore activists?  It seemed like you had a lot more patience and respect for the former klansman but maybe that was due to editing?
Hi Mr. Davis,  I saw you speak at the FIRE student conference in Philly in July, and I was so grateful to be there. You have one of the absolute best cases for defending the principle of free speech. Have you encountered any issues with the current generation of college students (or anyone at all) criticizing you for engaging with racial supremacists?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Adam Savage are:,"Mr. Savage, are you going to Silicon Valley Comic Con next year?
Hey adam! How is progress going on the martian suit?
Your comment on praying to the patron saint of ballistics has been immortalized as a quote in Sid Meier's Civilization 6. Any comment on that? http://i.imgur.com/ngfeK4n.jpg   EDIT: Fixed link.

Hi Mr. Savage, and greetings from Iceland. As some here surely know, the 'Mythbusters B-Team' has been up to no good and is due for a hopefully spectacular opening with their new show 'White Rabbit Project' on Netflix in just a few days. Have you been involved in any way with the project, even if just in an advisory role? Will we be getting a podcast about the show on tested.com? Are you or Jamie gueststarring in any of the episodes? Thanks for your time, and keep up the great work.
You recently announced a joint show with Michael from VSauce. How did this venture come about, why did you choose to do it, and what are you most excited about with that venture?
Hey Adam!  I loved the collaboration between you and Alton Brown, since you two were literally my childhood role-models. How was it working with him?  
You've inspired a lot of young people, myself included, to really delve into science and the scientific method, so thank you for helping me discover a passion, first of all!  If you had to add one person (dead or alive) to the Mythbusters team, who do you think would be best suited for the job?
Hey, Adam!  What are your essential cheap tools that everyone should own, and what are some that you feel need to be higher quality in order to be worth bothering with?
WHAT'S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH SIMONE GIERTZ?  Sincerely, Somebody else than Simone 😎
Hi Adam,  I recently discovered my college has it's own makerspace and club complete with 3D printers, a laser cutter, and a wood working shop. The only thing that it's missing is: makers!  What would be the best way to get people interested in a makerspace?
What's the coolest piece of science fiction you could see becoming a reality in the next 5-10 years?
Have you ever worn Jamie's hat?
Hi Adam,   Like everybody else, I love tested and the work you're doing to jump start Making. I'm a maker of music (or noise...) and I as wondering who you listen to on your drive to the shop or while you're working or just to decompress? Thanks for being such a huge inspiration to me!
What was the scariest thing you ever did on Mythbusters? 
I'm about to take my last physics test of the semester. Any words of advice?
Hi Adam,  Can't remember if you've ever answered this before but have you ever worked with the ""slow-mo guys""? They've dona a lot of really cool stuff filming things in super slow motion. The company they are apart of is also doing a really cool series called immersion, trying out things from video games in real life and seeing how easy/difficult they are.
Hi Adam!  I want to start off by thanking you, Mythbusters was a huge part of my childhood and it introduced me into the wonderful world of engineering. It helped me decide that I wanted to pursue a career in civil engineering, and now in my third year as a CE student I couldn't be happier with my decision. So thank you so much for that, and also for participating in this AMA today!  So my question for you is, is there any myth that you wanted to do but didn't have the right technology? If so, do you think it'll ever be possible to test it?  -Briana
Hey Adam! How are you doing today?
Hello Adam,   I am looking to get into creating/making, but over the years I've been doing things that could fit under making, or hobbyism, I've had tons of fun, but never really gotten all that good at anything or creative enough to come up with something really undone before. Now that my two daughters are getting older (three and six) and have both been to the NY Maker Faire, and love science and making things and such, I'm looking to get back in. What kind of resources can you recommend to a 37 year old father that can also potentially be useful in some way to the girls? We do have a Pi, and some of the ""toy"" making/enginnering stuff."

Daniel, did you keep anything from the set of Harry Potter?
If you had a Horcrux, what would it be?
What is the weirdest thing someone has asked you to sign? 
Something I've been really impressed with lately is that it seems like all of the kids that grew up acting in Harry Potter ended up very grounded and intelligent (this came to mind in particular when I saw an excerpt of an interview where you questioned how quickly people sexualized Emma Watson as soon as she turned 18). Was there an environment that helped with that, or would you attribute that more to your parents, or something else?

Some questions Reddit users might have to Gordon Ramsay are:,"In your opinion, what are 5 dishes that everyone needs to know how to cook?
Hi Gordon, do you ever just wander into a restaurant looking for a bite to eat, if so how do you decide where to go? If so, when you wander in do the staff visibly begin shitting themselves? 
Hi, Gordon. You're my hero. My girlfriend is typically not much of an adventurous eater; she is, however, curious to try casu marzu or ""maggot cheese"". Having witnessed you try it on *The F Word*, I have to ask: is she bonkers or am I?
What do you use a microwave for?
Hi Mr Ramsay,  I recently went to your restaurant ""Gordon Ramsay Steak"" at Paris in Las Vegas. I was wondering, exactly how much influence do you hold there? Is it a name sake or do you supervise all of the production and menu, etc?
https://youtu.be/3u-nQD-nwK8  In this video you're seen offering a job to an inmate after he beat you in an onion slicing contest. I was wondering if you could offer a follow up on this. Did he ever get the job?  Also I think it's a wonderful thing you did that day.

Will you ever open another location in Glasgow? The meal I had at Amaryllis remains hands down the best I've ever eaten.
Can you call me a fucking donkey please?
Hey Gordon -- I hope your leg is doing better.  Is there any dish a contestant has made on your Masterchef or Masterchef Junior that you still think about?  If so, have you ever used that contestants dish for creative influence in your own cooking?  Thank you. 
Chef what was your favorite moment on Masterchef, on or off camera?      Enjoyed your previous AMAs a lot, big fan sir.
Do you think the cook off between you and Bobby Flay will ever happen?

All beef or a blend of different proteins? 3) What chef did you most enjoy working for? Watching Marco Pierre White back in the day was hilarious!
Are you happy with how you're perceived by most people?  Everyone views you as the strict, takes-no-excuses, and frankly, mean chef.  After seeing scenes like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0zRSANWj1I) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsdLIpGsGno) from your Master Chef series, it's very clear that you have a lot of compassion for fellow chefs.  Do you think your tough, angry chef personality is often overplayed on your shows?

In a 2018 interview with Dean Takahashi you mentioned that had Bethesda not acquired the rights to *Fallout* you would have made an original post-apocalyptic universe.   What ideas did you have for this universe and how would it have differed from *Fallout*?  Thank you for your hard work and ask Emil how he ages backwards.
Hi Todd! Is the Amazon's Fallout TV Series still in the work? Is there any chance you can give us some details? ~~I'll buy an extra copy of Skyrim 🥺~~
I am currently playing Oblivion, any tips?
Hi Todd,   How do you even have time for this AMA when a settlement needs your help?   I’ve marked it on your map.
Todd! If you could be transported into any video game forever, what would it be and why?
I absolutely adored the Terminator games Bethesda did back in the 90s (still got the boxed copies!), the atmosphere of the future was so exceptionally realized when you consider the limitations of the time.   My question is this: Do you have any particular memory when it comes to the development of those games that stands out, and if the opportunity arose, would you ever consider going back to the Terminator IP for another game (not necessarily an FPS)?
I've read that a goal of *Starfield* is that it will be more of a ""hardcore RPG"". Can you verify this and flesh that out in more detail?  Does that mean that the character creation will be more complicated like it was in Morrowind and Oblivion?
Hey Todd! What type of mod support can we expect to see in creation kit engine 2 for Starfield?
You've repeatedly said tone is the first thing BGS prioritizes when designing a game.  How do you pick a tone to build an entire game around?  Are there conversations or even debates on what the tone should be?  Also, how do you preserve tone across so many different areas of development especially the non-visual ones (such as npc dialogue) that can't pull so directly from your studio's excellent concept art?
Hello, Todd!   In this past year, we saw the rise of some impressive Machine Learning tools that synthetize human voice, using assets from Skyrim (and other Bethesda games) to generate new realistic voice lines.   What do you think about this technology, in general? Do you have hope to use it in some future game? And do you think it will have a negative impact on the relationship between game studios and real voice actors?
You've mentioned in the past that certain features in Skyrim were cut or deemphasized because they didn't feel fun to play.  Has all that playtesting experience yielded any theories on what makes for a fun mechanic?  How do you incorporate playtesting experience when planning/designing your next game?
What do you think of Fallout: New Vegas?
Do you get to the cloud district very often?
Hey Todd,     I recently became creative director on a decently sized mod project, so it had me curious. What's your favourite aspect of being in the role, and what kind of advice would you give to someone fairly new to that kind of position?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to John Plant are:,"How long does it take you to edit the videos for your channel on average? Love the content!
Hey John, congrats on all the success! I'm an avid bushcrafter so I've been into your videos for a while. My questions, has any random person ever stumbled into your camp? Has your camp ever been vandalised?
Hey John, I love what you do. It takes a lot of dedication to continuously experiment and go out everyday.  Anyway, from what I understand the projects you do are quite labour-intensive and can take several months and several days at the project locations. My question is, do you bring any food and water with you from home or is food and water readily available onsite?
What kind of mindset do you get into when out in the wilderness?
First off I really love your content!  Do you have a job?  If yes: Does it have something to do with primitive technology and history?  If not: Would you want to do primitive technology for a living if you could?  And kinda silly but can you speak?
Hi John! Whatever happened to the stingless beehive you put ontop of your huts chimney?
Hey man, love the channel! You make it look easy. Do you ever get injuries? I never notice bandages. I know if it were me and I was in the bush with no shirt or shoes I'd be all sorts of cut up.
G'Day from Brissy, and congrats on the book! Sorry I have a few questions:   \- Do you stay out there the whole time, or do you head home most nights?   \- Did you get ripped from the labour involved in your projects, or do you have a gym membership?   \- Do you plan on making any more overseas visits to show how other cultures get it done?
I've been trying to get here for an hour now. Your ama just now showed up. Sorry.  I really enjoy watching your channel.   One question. How close are you to getting enough iron to make a small knife or whatever you are planning on making?
hello John. I love to watch your videos. keep it up, they are awesome. my questions: how many huts have you already built? how long do you use them each time? Are they close to each other? Can you create a map, where the huts are, where the kilns are and where the sweet potato fields are? this would be very interesting to see.  ps:  I have already ordered your book, fortunately it has been translated into German.
I love your content!!!  Wondering where you get your ideas from? As in, how'd you learn all these methods, and where/do you look for new ones?  Do you replant what you chop down?  Do you ever wear shoes?
G'day John, Congratulations on the book launch. Have watched your videos multiple times in fascination. Question - would you ever consider hosting bushcrafting days/tours? My wife has always wanted to go up to Queensland and could kill 2 birds with one stone learning first hand all you do
Hey Champion. First, love the videos. (And loved them even more when I figured out you had captions)  You are truly living out my childhood dream of building the ultimate cubby house. And as someone who had several attempts of making bows out of all sorts of crap.  Makes that one episode my favorite. So thank you for that.  Question,  On average, how many days in a month would you spend in the bush.  It seems the everything you do is very labor intensive.  And it looks like you would almost have to be there 24\7 for get any results.  Cheers again mate. Can't wait for the book. (P.S. are you going to narrate the audiobook? Ha!)
What about your ironmaking project? are you going to make a video again on this?
After you met Adam Savage. He said that he was surprised by the sound\tone of your voice. Do you get this reaction a lot?
John, every now and then I notice the smallest smirk on your face in a video.  How much editing do you have to do to maintain the stoic expression you hold through your channel?  Will you ever smile for the camera?
Hey John, thanks for the Ama.  Do you ever get fomo?   Is there a Mrs Plant in the picture? If not, what are your thoughts on this isolation?
Hey John! Have you ever been recognized on streets by some fans? How do they react about your channel and hobbies? And especially to The fact you can speak? Thanksss
I’m probably a little late to the party, but finally an AMA from someone I actually care about talking to!   I’ve watched all of your videos (multiple times), find them unbelievably relaxing, and I’m unbelievably jealous that you have that land to work on!   Also read your blog, it’s a disused plantation right?   How do you feel about all the people who have copied your style of videos?   I think you should start up a company offering primitive survival weekends, where people have to build their own shelter and stuff. I’m in the U.K. and I have looked at this type of thing but it’s usually basic bushcraft and I don’t need help building a fire lol.  Edit: put a link to your book? I’m going to buy that shit for myself this Christmas!!
Hey John, glad I caught this early before it inevitably explodes with questions. I've been following you for years,so thank you for all of the content you've released so far. Have there been any dangerous situations that you've been in while in the bush (animals, injuries, etc)?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Elizabeth Smart are:,"What's your opinion of journalists after your personal experience?  Was there any good for you that came from them and their reports, did you see some/many as exploitative?  
Did you suffer from PTSD?  How was the treatment, how long was that road?
What would you most like to tell us that no one has asked? 
What misconceptions about your abduction would you like to make people more aware of?
Were there moments when you thought ""this is it""? Conversely, were there moments when you thought ""this will all be over soon""?
Did you ever have any contact with Nancy Grace after the garbage she tried to pull with you?  BTW, I don't think you could've handled that any better.
In your opinion as a children's advocate, what are some practical, commonsense steps parents can take to help their children avoid abuse? (And I guess I mean abuse in a general way, anything from extreme bullying to abduction.) 
The most obvious question is ""how are you doing?"" and also what type of therapy has helped the most?
What was it like trying to re-join society? Do/did people always want to ask details or have they generally been respectful? 
Is there anything you noticed in your captor, whether it be a certain look or manner of speech that would serve as a red flag for you if seen/ heard from another person?  Or, rather, can you sense if someone you encounter is capable of such a thing?
How did you meet your husband? How has he been involved with your advocacy work?
I am a survivor of human trafficking, which actually started around the time you had went missing. When you were found I remember it giving me hope and something to keep working toward because it reminded me that there are people out there who care. What was the hardest thing you faced in terms of speaking out and becoming an advocate? I still have so much guilt tied to my experience and I'm 30 now and while I've worked through so much of that, I can't seem to fully accept that it was something that happened to me, not something that I did. If there was one main thing that you wanted to tell a survivor about speaking out, what would it be?
Hi Elizabeth, thank you for opening yourself up to us in this manner. I've held you in my thoughts and heart for years, just wishing you the best.  I'm just wondering, in general, how did your friends treat you after your return home? Have you stayed in contact with any of your friends from before your abduction, and were you able to find support in your friends upon return?  
Has your abduction created any challenges for you as a wife and a mother? 
How is it being a reporter for Crime Watch Daily? Do you like that type of work considering your past?
What is your favorite hobby?
In 2003 you were known as the girl who was kidnapped, today I think your advocacy work is defining you - in 40 years, when the public hears 'Elizabeth Smart' what do you want them to think of first? Or do desire a life outside the spotlight, where people don't recognize your name?
Is there anything ""in the moment"" that you did that you specifically think saved your life until the police came?
I hope no one misreads this and thinks it is a negative comment, but I was curious in the age of social media with your specific situation how do you deal with chuckleheads trying to get noticed at your expense either by harassing you or just posting flat out lies about you or your situation that thrust you into the media spotlight? Also, how do you handle (mentally and emotionally) any fake news stories written about you?
Do you think social media is a net good for the world?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Roy Moore are:,"The story said that you approached the accusers, not the other way around, but how did you know to investigate this in the first place?
I know you can't disclose what you are working on next, but would it be fair to say that you have been flooded with tips about other sexual predators that will keep you busy for a long time?  Would it be fair to characterize what we have seen so far as just the beginning?
Did Moore ever attempt to contact you directly and, if so, what did he say?
If a person has been sexually assaulted by a public figure, what is the best way to approach the media? What kind of information should they bring forward? 
Were there any allegations brought to your attention that were not reported due to lack of credibility?
How did you prepare the victims in the case for the obvious attacks from the gutter press and that their testimonies' and character would be brought into question. Did it put them off speaking out? Thanks, real honour to hear your insight. 
Your team was surely aware the report would be disputed by Moore’s ardent supporters, no matter how much research. Was there discussion over how to respond to a group that dismisses any and all evidence? Was there a need to convince them the allegations are credible, not biased?
Some people, including many prominent politicians, have said that these are ""40 year old allegations"" and that diminishes their importance and that they were only brought up to prevent him from getting the seat in the Senate. How do you respond to that? Do you believe that these stories should break in a way/time to have maximum impact?   Edit: I do believe the allegations and think that they are absolutely important to know. I also understand why the story is being given attention now-especially with the WaPo's answer below-and think it's a great thing it received national attention.
The night before the election, one of Roy Moore's Army buddies told an anecdote of a time they witnessed a fellow soldier patronize a brothel, in Vietnam, that he said had ""very young girls"" - has there been any investigation into that claim or is it not worth chasing? 
Hi, great work!! I am a journalist and wish to know how you initially discovered -- before you found out the information Stephanie laid out in the video -- that the woman sent by Project Veritas was not telling the truth? Any tips on how to better vet people who I interview and who are dishonest and attempting to pull off a hoax would be much appreciated, thanks!
How big was the web of enablers? Or was it just shrugged off by the people around him as something that was somehow culturally acceptable?
Do you think Roy Moore will still have a career in Alabama politics after all of this?
What are your thoughts on this mysterious ""Bernie Bernstein"" guy who apparently works for the Post?
Can you PLEASE do some sleuthing on Ajit Pai? Asking for a friend. 
Now that the election race is over do you think the victims will be taken more seriously? There was a good amount of Alabama white women and men voters thought the allegations were faked to derail Moore.   Edit: I was wrong to think it was majority [source. scroll down to where it says most women and independents thought allegations were true. ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/alabama-exit-polls/?utm_term=.df9c6a2105da) 
The 5th reported person to accuse Roy Moore was Beverly Young Nelson (with the Year Book). She appears to have been brought to the media's attention by Gloria Allred. Did the WaPo vet and check her story before adding her to the Washington Post's list of accusers? 
Based on your experience with the accusers why do you believe they chose to make themselves public now rather than during one of Judge Moore's other statewide campaigns? Do you believe the #meToo movement empowered them - or was there some other factor?
A common rejoinder used by Moore's supporters is that this kind of harassment was not seen as unusual or perverted in 1970s Alabama. Is this the impression you got from interviewing witnesses in the Gadsden area, or did they view Moore as a predator?
Have there been attempts from groups other than Project Veritas to seed disinformation in order to discredit your investigation?  If so, will those be revealed?  Also, as an aside, will you please pass on our most profound thanks to the women whose bravery exposed Roy Moore (further) for what he is.  I cannot even fathom the courage and tenacity they had to summon to tell their story.  This country is in their debt for helping to save us from the corrupted rule of power mongers like Moore.  All the very best to them.
I do have a question. Partially related to this.  Last month, someone from Project Veritas tried to give you fake accusations in order to discredit you and discredit the legitimate accusations against Moore, until you caught them.  Do you have any plans to file a lawsuit or anything like that against Project Veritas?"

Hi Jon! I'm a huge fan! What was the most unexpected thing a guest ever said or did on your show?
Thanks for doing this!  When you went on Crossfire, did you expect to confound the hosts the way you did? Was it your mission from the start to disrupt their whole theater of debate (and lead to their demise), or just to engage them about the nature of their show?  (Context for those of you not familiar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE )
Hi Jon! Huge fan!  This is something I've wondered during my 5 years of watching the Daily Show:  What do you usually whisper in your guests' ear after concluding the interview?
Jon,    Please explain what about the script of ""The Faculty"" made you come to the conclusion that ""Yes, I have to be in this movie.""?  Was it the ""Now I am going to check your prostrate"" line?
Help me Jon Stewart, you're my only hope. In Episode IV, How did the Dianoga, or trash compactor monster, not get crushed? Are we to assume he was birthed in the trash compactor or was placed there?  Also you are the voice of a generation, media icon, yada yada yada...  
Can you please share with us one fact about Big Daddy that isn't common knowledge?

I was recently bitten by a radioactive Chris Pratt.  What is about to happen to me?
Hey Chris!  I always enjoyed Andy Dwyer on Parks and have been so happy to see you become so successful. I know there is a behind the scenes video from the set of Parks and Rec of you pretending to get a call from Steven Spielberg asking you to be in the next Jurassic Park.

Chris!  We’ve had the pleasure of hosting Nick Offerman a couple times, and when asked about you, he brought up phrases including but not limited to “magnificent beast”, and “most beautiful creation”. Do you have a response that can go on record?
My landlord says you used to rent the same house as me back when you were filming Everwood. Is this true? (The house in question, Salt Lake City, Utah http://imgur.com/opWPtqA) We've also gotten some junk mail addressed to ""Chris P. Pratt"", but p isn't your middle initial.

Hey Chris loved you in guardians of the galaxy and I'm stoked for Jurassic world. I have two questions.   1) what's it feel like going from living in a van at 19 to now being a movie star and being able to afford basically anything you want?  2) what advice would you give someone like me who wants to be an actor?   Thanks for doing this!  
Hey Chris! I heard you met your wife, Anna Faris, on set during a movie. You're both great, I've loved her since the first Scary Movie but Chris you've stolen my heart since Parks and Rec. When I first discovered you two were married I was blown away because I thought you guys are perfect for each other, all while I tried to smother my intense jealousy. My questions for you are what drew you two together? Is there some cute story in which you guys fell in love? Is Anna a great wife/mom?
If you could change a word from the title of any films or television show you've starred in, what would the new title be?  Example, ""Sharks and Rec""
Hi Chris,  I’m a big fan, thanks for doing this AMA!  I have three questions:  How did you and Chris Evans become friends?  Are you a fan of the HBO series “Game of Thrones” and if so who’s your favorite character?  Finally, your favorite pizza toppings?  Thanks Chris! 
Chris...I read the book of Jurassic Park before I saw the movie and I have to say while I thought the movie was great and well-made, it lacked of lot of the grittiness and intense moments the books captured. Can we expect a reboot more towards the books in this movie?   Also...are you yourself a Lego master builder? If so, what set(s) are your favorite sets? Classic, modern, themed,etc?
How much of Ben Wyatt is just Adam Scott being Adam Scott?
How can I convince my friends that Jurassic World is gonna be great? 
Hi Chris!  Less than a month ago [I made an April Fool’s Day post on the r/movies subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/311bwj/chris_pratt_has_just_said_to_the_mods_if_you_get/) saying that: you told us that you would do an AMA if we got a picture of your abs to the top of reddit.   I April Foolsed a bunch of people and it get to the top of reddit with 1.5 million views. A week later your AMA was officially announced.  **My question is did this post have anything to do you with deciding to do an AMA?** ^^Pls ^^say ^^yes.   
Hey Chris, welcome to Reddit! Super excited that you’re here with us today.  Two questions for you:  * What would be in your perfect sandwich?  * Are there any fictional characters from literature that you would like to portray?  That's all! Thanks again for doing this AMA! :)"

My question: were you going commando in that there shark costume?
I want to know: who designed this show and came up with the shark idea?
> 5. Would you rather fight one ~~Katy Perry~~ giant lion-tron -sized duck or 100 duck-sized ~~Katy Perrys~~ lion-trons? 
Did you tell ""I'M A SHAAAAARK, I'M A SHAAAAARK, SUCK MY DIIIIICK, I'M A SHAAAAARK"" at any point? 
How did you manipulate the fins and mouth at the same time? 
Is it for sale? Halloween is calling my name. 
How much were you paid, if you were paid?  Also, my kids loved the sharks.  One of them ran up and down the living room saying ""shark eat me"".  To my kids, you really were the star of the show.  Thank you and Great job!
Would you drown if you stopped moving?

Is the video of halftime you edited in a joke?  I've never seen anything produced so badly and actually uploaded."
Some questions Reddit users might have to Mike Rowe are:,"What dirty jobs did you always want to do but the network or producers wouldn't let you do? (too dangerous, inappropriate, so on)  Thanks for the AMA and good job with your skilled workers scholarship!
What job shocked you the most by finding out how awful it really was? 
Mike, I work for a company that squishes poop. I would have thought squishing poop is easy, but it turns out it's more complicated than it sounds.   Sometimes we do beer and stuff, but usually it's poop.  Would you be interested in squishing poop with me or one of the other guys here?  **Edit:** Figured I'd ask since if you're doing a Baltimore Somebody's Got To Do It, you could stop by while you're in the area.  -----  **Edit 2:** Since a bunch of people asked, I've gotten tentative approval for a group AMA with our poop squishing experts right before Thanksgiving. Everybody can find out what's going to happen to their Thanksgiving dinner after they're done with it.  I've also been told there will be lots of cake. This makes me nervous.
Hey Mike, what profession have you gained the most respect for over the years?
Why do you still choose to live moderately even though you have made enough money to not do so? I saw the emails online that people send you and you reply and you sent a guy a picture of your view outside your apartment and there is a smokestack outside of it. why are you so humble??!   Huge fan thanks so much for doing this AMA!!
Hey Mike!  If you had to choose one job to do permanently, out of all the ones you tried out on Dirty Jobs, what would it be?  Also, your voice is what I imagine Gods voice sounds like  
I really appreciate the work you do for trade activism, and the revival of blue collar trades. As someone who lives in Alberta, Canada where the trades seem to flourish, what are the biggest obstacles in the fight against the decline of the blue collar trades in the States?
How has the transition to CNN been? Also, what was the reason for the move?
Hello Mike, thanks for the AMA!  I'm an old guy who makes stuff, so I do appreciate your message.  Last year you were scheduled to host a segment of the inaugural redditgifts Shopping Network on Black Friday.  Unfortunately, that event had some production issues, the plug was pulled early, and I don't think you got to do your segment.  I had made a ***Mike Rowe Works*** plaque that was supposed to be presented to you during your segment.  So for the question: I just kinda wanna know, like, did you ever get it?  If not, do you want it?  If so, give Victoria a shipping address and I'll get it out.  Pics below.  [Pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/JHAAWna.jpg)    [Pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/sZxmlrl.jpg)   
Hey Mike!   I always got a good chuckle out of your [QVC](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esXvk9AV0MI) days, have you ever considered reuniting with them as a goof now that you're so successful? And how long did it take for your fellow co-workers to catch on to your sarcasm or did they all just think you were really strange?  *PS: I always thought you had such a lovely speaking voice and was so impressed when I found out you used to sing opera, so kewl! For anyone who doesn't know, [educate yourself](http://vimeo.com/2904394), the man can sing!*
Why should I watch your new show? Also, what is your favorite deli meat? 
Hey, Mike!  Thank you so much for Dirty Jobs. It changed the way I look at the American industry.   Do you keep in touch with any of the people you met at any of your dirty jobs?
Mike, have you ever considered being a Walmart employee on Black Friday for one of your shows? After all, somebody's gotta do it; and, considering the language and throws I've seen on BF, it can be a pretty dirty job.
Hi Mike.  As a Baltimoron, I've been intrigued by the recent back and forth between you and David Simon.  Any chance the two of you get together for a town hall meeting and see what common ground is found and what ideas are generated?   
Hey mike, I really like what you do on dirty jobs showing people to respect the people that work those hard jobs. I know you've worked a bunch of dirty jobs on your show, but which dirty job was the hardest on you both physically and mentally?
Favorite place to go in Baltimore?
Hey Mike, always wondered..ever had an experience with a ghost?
Hey Mike, aside from Troy, is there anyone from Dirty Jobs working on your new show?  edit: -screams- Thanks for the reply!
If you went to a guidance counselor in high school, what would he/she have said your ideal job would be?
Mike!  As a fellow Eagle Scout, I got your ""form letter"" about 5 years ago when I got my Eagle at 15 years old. If there was any life lesson you learned in Scouting that you could pass onto the rest of us, what would it be?  Stay dirty, you great man you."
Some questions Reddit users might have to Sophie Zhang are:,"Thank your for the important work you’re doing. In your opinion, what is the reason that FB drags it’s feet/allows these schemes to continue so long before taking action? Is it simply that it is the more profitable move?
Thanks so much for this AMA.  Organizationally speaking, how high up in the org did your findings go (or not go) before they were quashed or ignored.  In other words, was there support for your work by your direct manager or their manager but then above that you ran into issues?  Or was your direct manager even unsupportive?
Thank you for your work and ethics. I've been following the news, reddits, etc regarding you. You always describe yourself as a data engineer and point out that you were tracking the metadata in discovering the problems you have reported.  I have a two part question for you.  Could you ELI5 :) what a data engineer is and how you use metadata to find problems as you have described?   I'm not asking for specific cases here. I just want to enhance my own understanding (I sorta get it) while also helping everyone else understand what it is that you do and did and why it is important. I just feel that something gets lost in the articles describing what you do and how. Am I being clear?
What were your discoveries with regard to the Philippines? Here, it's widely-known that politicians make use of troll armies.
Can we do Reddit now? I've long suspected that Reddit has at least as much opinion manipulation as FB.
Since leaving Facebook, what are your goals for the next 5 years? Are you able to stay in the tech world, or does the Facebook termination serve as a block with finding new work?
Do rank and file FB employees talk to each other about how bad FB is for the world? Or do you think they’ve just drunk the Kool-Aid and think the company is great? I'm talking about people like ad account managers, content policy associates, software engineers. FB employees are really smart and get recruited from the best schools in the world. The problems with FB are so public and so well reported that it's hard for me to understand why people continue to work there.
How true are foreign fake click farms as shown on the Sillicon Valley tv show, with rows and rows of indians creating fake account after fake account to boost userbase numbers or promote an agenda?  Heres the scene: https://youtu.be/Y-W0CBOGnnI
Hi Sophie,  One of the more frequently discussed dimensions of influence operations - especially in the United States - is the observed disparity between operations that target people with right-aligned political views and people with left-aligned political views.  In the data you ran, what did you observe with respect to political alignment? And if you did observe a disparity, how wide was the divide? Do you have any theories as to why you observe this?
Hi!  Slightly long-winded question, but how did you identify areas where inauthentic behavior might be occurring?    Was there a systematic or ad hoc analysis or flagging system internally or externally identifying potential regions or countries where inauthentic activity might be occurring, particularly inauthentic activity which might incite violence or be detrimental to democracy?  Thank you!
How are people still able to set up fake accounts these days given all the security and authentication that seems to be in place around the account setup?   What does Facebook do with an account that it identifies as inauthentic?

hey Sophie, thanks for joining us today! two questions for you:  If you were given unlimited resources/remit, how would you tackle troll farms?  What's something you wished you were able to spend more time on?
What's your favorite film?
While at FB, were you involved with any cases that involved FB calling or reaching out to police authorities?
Hi Sophie,  As Armenians we're regularly targeted by bot armies and disinformation/ hate campaigns organized by the government of Azerbaijan on Facebook and other social media platforms.  The major players don't seem to care about nefarious behavior targeted at groups that don't have political/economic clout in the United States, especially when the offending content is not in the English language.  What do you think we can do to get these companies to take this problem more seriously and devote the necessary resources to moderating these activities, especially when it appears in non-English content?  Thanks!  P.S. Thanks for having the courage to be a whistleblower. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed or unappreciated.
Have you ever been specifically targeted by trolls once they are aware of your efforts?
If some of these troll farms took a year to get authorized to be taken down, what sort of things did you see as not encountering any resistance and being removed immediately?  Was there any specific criteria where certain types/sources of content were scrubbed quickly?
Are there any trends you’ve noticed since your departure from FB that are concerning?"

Hi Ryan! Recently I have heard talk about a push to get more Mayors involved in national politics, as opposed to Governors and Senators, because Mayors tend to be much more community-oriented and understanding of what kind of change has to occur on a local level. Mayor Pete Buttigieg running for DNC chair is somewhat representative of this movement.  What are your thoughts on the view Mayors can help bring to national politics that a Governor or Senator might not be able to?   Also what are some things that people often, mistakenly, think the President or Congress are in control of, when in reality it is their local Mayor or city officials in charge of issues that directly impact them?
I remember reading your name somewhere in my AP Gov class. And yeah, we joked about you being Deadpool about 50 times before it started getting less funny. Sorry.   Anyways. How do you have time for gym, gaming, and game of thrones as Mayor? Do you have a lot of free time on a daily basis?

As someone who lives 30 minutes from Whitney point.  What do you think of the things that Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick is doing? Namely the safe injection sites for heroin user? I ask because we face an epidemic and the more respected officials we have advocating for harm reduction will help the fight communities face with addiction and the problems associated.  Thank you for the AMA
What's the biggest thing you wish you could change about Whitney Point?   What do you think is the best attraction for tourists in Whitney Point?   Where do you think Whitney Point has the best opportunity to improve fiscally for 2017? What will it take to make that happen?   Currently Whitney Point is receiving an ""F"" for education, a C- for employment, and a D for housing. Do you think $800k would go further in education than a renovated building? Or would $400k be better invested in attracting business rather than building a look-out?   Cost of living and crime both receive A's, congratulations on that - what do you think is the biggest factors are in receiving those grades?   I've never been to Whitney Point. I'm actually on the west coast of Canada. Why should I go?
How will you convince Hugh Jackman to team up with you for Deadpool & Wolverine?
Are you going to build a super cool winter sports complex for your citizens to enjoy? You could call it Ice Town!
Hey Ryan I'm from Ithaca, who's older you or Svante?  Do you two ever get together to discuss being young mayors?  2nd question do you get your water from the spring on 79?  If not you should, it's more refreshing than Fiji."

In the Netflix documentary series, one thing that was quite remarkable to me was how you and your team were able to design a nuclear reactor that produces uses already nuclear waste as a fuel. However this design was never implemented due to political reasons.   My question is: Given that this technology has the potential to be the most-effective green energy source and have a key role in reversing climate change, what’s the current status on the project? Is it a likely possibility that this nuclear reactor will be built in the upcoming years? If so, do you plan on building in China or would you consider building such a project on US soil? Thanks.

Do you think there will be long-term ramifications of everyone going through covid in the next few months because people are unwilling to prevent the spread anymore?

Hello Senator Paul, first let me thank you for taking the time to answer peoples' questions.  What is your stance on Edward Snowden? Or more generally, do you believe that there is a point where whistleblowing is the right thing to do, or should this sort of behavior be considered plain and simple apolitical crime?
Hi Senator Paul! My question is: What issue/problem do you believe is the most important that our nation faces today and why? How would you remedy the situation?  Thank you! (from a huge supporter)

Hi Dr. Paul,   What do you think of the popular gif of your father? On a scale of funny to hilarious, how would you rate it? [Said gif](http://i.imgur.com/7drHiqr.gifv)
Hello Rand,  I write for my school newspaper much like you did. In your old articles you seem to hold the same views, it is clear you do not pander for votes. Do you believe there are any hard obstacles that we as a nation have to unite and face that other politicians won't touch due to criticism?

If elected President in what ways would you help legalize cannabis?
Hi, Senator Paul! I'm happy to say that I'll be voting for the first time this year, and as it stands now, you are the candidate that matches my positions on major issues far more closely than any other candidate.  I'm interested to know about your thoughts on getting legislation through two opposing sides of a particularly stubborn congress. It seems that less and less is getting done lately because of a growing polarity both in government and in American society. That said, my two main questions follow:  1. What do you think is the best strategy for getting both parties on board to take action on bipartisan issues?  2. What do you think must change (if anything) in the general legislative process to make bipartisan agreements more common?  Thank you very much, and good luck with the campaign and election!
If you were in a televised debate with your dad, what policy position of his would you call him out on?
What's your favorite movie?
Hi Senator Paul,  I greatly enjoyed your Periscope stream during the GOP debates the other week! That being said, I have two questions.   1) It seems that the GOP party and the media have been trying to hide you in a sense, and keep people from learning about you, your policies, and your rank in the polls. Why do you think they intend to do this?  2) Bernie Sanders recently released his healthcare plan, before the Dem Debate several days ago. What main faults, besides the tax increases, do you find with his healthcare plan?
Thanks for doing this. I've followed you and your dad for years so I know most of your policy positions so I'll pose an alternate question:  If you had to exist in an alternate universe, would you choose Star Wars universe, Harry Potter universe, Lord of the Rings universe, or some other?  Thanks.  (If you choose Star Wars, keep in mind what happens to most politicians in that universe).  :)
Senator,  What is the one economic or classically liberal notion that you think fervent supporters of Bernie Sanders are missing or do not understand?"

Jeff, which movie do you prefer to watch, Tron or Tron Legacy? Did they let you have any input on either storyline, most importantly though Tron Legacy as we all had plenty of time to think about where we thought or felt the story direction should go?  Tron has special meaning to me. As a kid my Dad took us to see it in the theater. We were so blown away by it we sat through it twice, without paying for the second showing. My first experience with being a nerdy badass. So when Tron Legacy came out I made sure and bought tickets and took my Dad to see it. We sat through it twice as well. Thanks for the memories.

Thank you for all of it, by the way. The Dudette abides.
How do you feel about playing the Giver when the role was initially intended to be played by your father? Does the role and/or story have a bigger impact on you?
Hey Jeff, big fan! You’ve been involved with efforts to bring The Giver to the screen for years, originally envisioning your father in the role you’re now playing. What drew you to the book, and how does it feel finally seeing it made after so many years?"

Hi Sophie. I was wondering if you know whether any sort of database of this kind of behavior exists? Specifically, do you know about anywhere I could go to find out which countries have a high spread of the kind of digital misinformation you've worked on? Thanks!
A question for users while I go through:     There are many many questions here. I don't think I'll be able to go through them all. Even sorting by new, the questions come in faster than I can answer them.     How would people recommend me to prioritize which questions I chose to answer?

I'm begging and pleading with people to do the right thing, but I get being ignored or waved off. There comes a point when you just can't take it anymore.   For you, what was the jumping off point when you realized that you had to say something?  How do you intend to deal with the professional fallout?
Hey! Thank you for what you did, tech culture has made it very easy for most tech people to disassociate themselves from the political consequences of the work that they do for their employers.  My question: A few years ago in Nicaragua we went through a socio-political crisis which ended up in hundreds of civilians killed by the government. Around the same time a vast number of pro-government accounts in social media, specially on Facebook, popped up. Are you aware of any inauthentic pro-government networks active around this time (2018)?  Thanks again!  (re-asking as the original comment didn't include a question mark and it was automatically removed; hopefully you are still able to see this)
Facebook is hiring something like 6,000 new employees right now. What would you tell someone joining the company to try to change things""from the inside?""
You mentioned a lot of accounts were set up to spread false information about the pandemic, who controls those?
Most of the examples you gave in the Guardian were of governments using fake engagement to manipulate domestic politics within their own countries, rather than the politics of other countries.  Was this just more common, or is there another reason?
There is so much content manipulation on all the major social media platforms, [including reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/), and other internet centers of commerce, like Amazon.  As we try to build and evolve a better internet, do you think we are going to have to sacrifice a level of anonymity in exchange for improved integrity?  How do you think we should strike that balance?
As an insider, what do you think is the first step to reform Facebook?   The size is an obvious problem from my outside perspective; also, ultimate control resting in one person's hands. I'm looking forward to reading the deep dive in The Guardian.
I am a whistleblower too. I was forced out of my job as a marine biologist for reporting the Alabama Marine Resources Division for violating the Marine Mammal Protection Act. However, since it will make the Republican Governor look bad, NO media outlet will publish the story.  How do you suggest I get my story out?
Other popular social media platforms besides Facebook—like Twitter—have responded slowly to inauthentic activity, and FB has coordinated its responses to certain kinds of inauthentic activity. What that coordination look like from your experience? Has that coordination been effective, or has it detracted from the policing of IA? Has FB coordinated its de-prioritization of  of certain IA with other social media?
Do you think there is a political agenda on reddit or any sort of social manipulation going on for political gain?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Adam Savage are:,"hi adam - what was one myth that you were sure deep down in your heart was true but that you had to admit was false after you guys put it to the test?
If you could blow anything up, what would it be?
Is Jamie's personality on the show all an act? Or is he really that dry in real life? And what is it with that guy when he has a helmet on?! 
Does Tory still feel bad about shocking you?
Do your kids go to Comicon with you, and do they dress up? 
Hi Adam,  I normally miss when these are happening so I'm glad I caught this one.   Is there any myth you've heard that you would never want to try to bust? 
One thing I always wondered while watching mythbusters. Was there ever a reason you only ever wore all black?
Hi Adam,   a few years ago, you and Jamie were on a local radio station in Los Angeles.....KROQ.  You had callers call in and pitch ideas to you both, but you warned them, and told them that you LIKELY have already heard everything.  Someone called in and said that when he was driving tanker trucks...he was told that if he was not careful, the nozzel at the back of the tanker truck could ignite and turn the tanker truck into a sort of ROCKET.  Both you and Jamie paused for a moment...and then you said something like ""That....is going on a short list...that is amazing""  Did anything ever come from that?  
When you were young, what did you think you were going to be when you grew up?
What maker skill do you lack and most covet? And whose skill do you most admire?
What's the one experiment that you've always wanted to do but haven't been able to due to production restrictions (OH&S, budget .etc)?
Adam,  Just wanted to say, I'm a huge fan of Tested, and I deeply appreciate the level of detail you guys showcase on the channel.  And I love seeing your toys ;)  Question: With current education standards, do you believe that there are gaping holes where kids are missing out on creative experiences? Making, building, etc.   What would you like to see implemented in to our education systems? (Not just in the Bay Area, but in low income communities)  
Hi Adam,  I met you ever so briefly at Dragoncon in '08, in what could only be described as a rushed meet and greet fitting in as many people as possible. It was still awesome to say thank you and shake your hand.  What is the most memorable time you have had at a con?
Hey Adam! Thank you doing this AMA. I was just wondering what is the memorable time you've met a fan on the street?
What would you say are the most important skills to learn for model and prop making? What would old Adam tell yourself at a younger age that would have helped out the most? 
Hello, Mr. Savage. Big fan of yours growing up. Something I've always wanted to know; if you could pick one other person to co-host an episode of mythbusters with, who would it be?
Have you ever ran into someone who was cosplaying as you at a con? I love your work on mythbusters, and watch your videos on Tested, my fave are the one day build videos. 
Hey Adam!   Now that RobotWars is back, do you plan to try and participate again? 
Is there still a place to submit myth ideas online? The only place I could find looks like it was last updated in 2012.   Hope this gets to you because my myth would be  What would happen if a human swam out into the bellagio fountains and was on top of one of the Jets of water. Would he fly up with the water and die? Would the water cut right through him creating a giant hole?  Or would he escape unharmed?    Edit : found the thread in /r/mythbusters to submit and submitted this. 
Hi Adam, How do you feel about programs like FIRST and Vex? Do you think they're eventually going to be successful in the cultural revolution they're trying to reach?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Rick Smith are:,"Any comment on a recent NPR study that says the police find the taser less effective than the company claims?  https://www.npr.org/2019/06/27/729922975/despite-widespread-use-police-rate-tasers-as-less-effective-than-believed
Have you ever felt that police over-use their Taser specifically because it is non-lethal?
Have you been tasered?
Hi Rick, thank you for doing this AMA.   This is probably a pretty niche question, but as a prosecutor, I regularly work with your company's body cams. Over the past few years, I've noticed the amount of body cam footage has increased exponentially both due to greater adoption by agencies and also greater use among officers in the place of traditional recorded interviews and scene photos. How are you preparing to deal with the massive increase in upload, storage, and downloads in the coming years as body camera use continues to expand? Is there any work being done to make the process easier for the end user? I know there's been days when I would have loved to have a desktop based download manager that could queue files and resume downloads after interruptions.
I appreciate tasers in principle as less-lethal options but I worry about head injuries when I see tasered subjects fall.  Has there been any research done in that area?
What's your opinion about police using tasers as compliance weapons? I'm not talking about drive stun -- I'm talking about repeated discharging of the weapon on someone who was already tasered once. I've seen quite a few videos where police say, ""Roll over (or do X) or else you're gonna get it again!"" after the suspect has been shot once and is already on the ground.  I understand that for a rural officer dealing with an armed man, this is probably warranted and preferable to shooting him. But so many times, I see people who are unarmed and are merely non-compliant (for example, they're already on the ground but just not rolling over). Taser is meant to incapacitate, and the suspects are already incapacitated -- and yet the officer applies it again and again as a compliance tool. Is this how taser should be used? Is this how officers are trained?
What's your favorite Jackie Chan movie?
Didn't Axon Enterprises created facial recognition software for use by the police? Did the [project really stop](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761084/axon-taser-facial-recognition-ban-ethics-board-recommendation), or is it on pause for the moment? Would greater transparency around the process help the public understand the dangers to law enforcement's use of such technology, particularly given its various constraints and its [racist applications](https://www.eff.org/files/2018/02/15/face-off-report-1b.pdf)? Could you speak to the use of FRT (facial rec technology) by police and why Axon started created the software to be deployed in things like body-worn cameras in the first place? Did no one at Axon notice that they were potentially creating a mass surveillance system?
Hi Rick,   Can you please explain why Taser [sues medical examiners who cite tasers as a cause of death](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/02/tasers-delirium-defense/)? And why they push junk science [""excited delirium""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_delirium) (a once-obscure medically-unsupported cause of death that, though it predates Taser, has been heavily pushed by the company) explanations rather than the obvious (being electrocuted to death)?
Hey Rick,   I'm a current LEO and our department is the only one in the county (on top of being the largest in the county) who dont carry and use tasers.  We usually hear the same talk of them being too expensive, too aggressive looking, and them possibly being abused if we got them.  I think the town manager is currently for them, but our chief seems to be very much against them.  I think we might get body cameras before we actually get tasers.  What are some things we could say to change their minds?
Hey Rick! If you're still on I have a burning question.      How many times have you tested your non-lethal weapons on yourself/on partners? (In a safe environment of course)
Hello. I wouldn't have expected to be interested in this thread, but you seem very genuine and honest in your answers so far.  You mentioned the Star Trek phaser and its ""stun"" setting. Do you ever see such a weapon becoming available one day?
Hey. Obviously you're product is meant primarily for law enforcement. My question though is what are your feelings about civilian ownership of your products?  Apologies if this question's been asked already
I've read some opinions/studies that claim less than lethal weapons increase escalation and  police use it instead of de-escalating with words or physical force and not instead of using their gun. Since a taser, or most less lethal weapons, can kill this is obviously not a good thing.   I for one am quite glad the police here don't carry tasers and most if not all less lethal weapons are illegal for the general public. But on the other hand we don't have the same issue with gun violence that the US has.  What's your view of this?
What's your view on Tranq darts as they seem to be your prime competitor?
How would you go about transitioning away from lethal weapons for domestic law enforcement when criminals have access to similar weapons but don't adhere to any principles?
Hello Rick,  I noticed that Axon is getting into virtual reality training for law enforcement. I think that's pretty neat. Do you have any plans to expand this in the future? Could be an interesting opportunity to add more startup acquisitions to your belt if you do want to keep moving in this direction.
Hi Rick. Currently in my new hire orientation at Axon and they gave us a copy of your book! Excited to read it later.  Hearing your story was inspirational. What are some of the key challenges that lie ahead for the company? What has been the most challenging thing for you so far?
It's a pretty well-known fact that the taser is named after the book [*Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Swift_and_His_Electric_Rifle), which featured -- at least, according to Wikipedia -- Jack Cover's 'childhood hero' Tom Swift.  Be honest: were you and the other early developers all on board with that as a name? Or did you think it was a *bit* of a strange choice to name it after a children's book? How did that pitch go?

Hi Wallace. Thanks for the AMA!  There’s been some grumbling about redoing the Princess Bride.

What role do you think was your biggest departure from yourself as an artist ?   Deepest thanks for your massive contribution to my entertainment !"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Brendan Fraser are:,"Jesus, fuck this post. I know the dude is largely a meme at this point but if you actually care about him, why would you immediately jump to asking about the most negative thing possible in an AMA? If the dude is having issues why would he discuss it with a Reddit fanbase that treats it like a joke?   You really think he's going to fucking want to be assaulted with reminders of this shit? No way he's going to respond to this. I hope he comments here just to give you a nice ""fuck you"" and leaves.   How bout we concentrate on hyping our boi back into action instead?
Why is Reddit obsessed with him? I'm genuinely curious. 
Anybody else love him from Scrubs??
How do feel about the mummy being redone even though you nailed it?
""Mr. Fraser, huge fan.  At any point while filming the movie gem Encino Man, did you say to yourself 'this movie is just TOO good'?""
Wasn't he paying a shit ton of alimony?   Poor guy.
Can we all agree that we still love Brendan Fraser?
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DIE IN SCRUBS ? 
I'm not saying Brendan Fraser is the best actor in the history of ever, but the dude IS a very good actor. It's weird he was so big in the 90s and then just kind of disappeared.  The funny thing is that he still has a pretty big fan base. Does he understand that there are still plenty of people who want to see him in stuff...?

Do you believe that vaccines cause Autism?  If not, how would you feel about doing a film about [Andrew Wakefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield), the man who is largely responsible for that myth?  Wakefield [looks like](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/16/09/andrew-wakefield.jpg) a somewhat uglier version of you, and with a bit of makeup and a British accent, I think you could give a great performance.  The film would not only give you a chance to experiment with a more serious role than you've had in the past, but it would also help to expose the myth for what it is, and could potentially save lives.
I have a friend named Brandon Frazer who is a drag queen, would you like me to have him do an AMA?
You are mainly known for your goofball roles like George of the Jungle, Encino Man, Dudley Do Right, The Mummy, etc, but I find your acting in dramas to be top notch. I loved watching you act in Gods and Monsters, The Quiet American, and Extraordinary Measures. Think you will be doing more serious roles?  Also, I think you would make a great psycho/super villain. 
Here's a question:  What was it like working with a hoard of animatronic apes & swinging on vines? You know, in that movie..looney tunes back in action. 😆

Encino man and blast to the past sequels please?

Some questions Reddit users might have to Rick Smith are:,"How did you find the colluder??
I understand how shorts can make money especially by artificially creating bad press. How do they bring a company down?

What do you think is the reason that the Taser XREP (Shotgun Model) didn’t get the interest that it deserved? Is a longer ranged Taser something that Axon is considering in the future?
In recent weeks I’ve heard Chamath, Cuban, and now you speak about short seller legislation to create transparency- what is the argument against such legislation? Is there any counterpoint against it? Or is it just completely common sense legislation that is ignored due to corruption?   I’d like to understand both sides of the debate.

When you realized how the community as a whole was rallying around WSB, Gamestop and against shortselling as a whole, what was your initial reaction? Also now that the initial 'hype' has sort of dwindled, do you see a brighter future ahead with upcoming congressional hearings and reforms?

Hi Bill. Many years ago, I think around 2000, I heard you say something on TV like, “people are vastly overestimating what the internet will be like in 5 years, and vastly underestimating what it will be like in 10 years.”  Is any mammoth technology shift at a similar stage right now? Any tech shift - not necessarily the Internet
The cost of living  has skyrocketed, wages ate stagnant.  A lot of people are effectively in survival mode.   How do we get corporations and the ultra wealthy to pay better wages, pay their taxes.

Hey Sean, big fan of the show!  Have you ever considered doing hot sauce reviews on First We Feast?  Also, what are your top 3 favorite tasting hot sauces for wings?
Hey Sean, I’m a huge fan of yours! I have two questions for you:  -	What do you do to prepare your body for so much spicy food? I love hot stuff but it wreaks havoc on my system.  -	How do you prepare to ensure the interview is the best it can be? In my opinion you’re one of the greatest interviewers in the business, and it would be cool to know the process.  Also the hot ones sauce is really expensive to ship to Canada, you guys should definitely open up a shop here. We need some heat to warm our cold winter-conditioned bodies. 
Hey Sean, love watching your show every Thursday, with Mac Demarco on the show recently, do you plan on having any more indie rock kind of guest on soon?

Did the dj khaled episode lower your opinion of him?
What is the process for choosing the guests? Has Hot Ones gained enough traction and word of mouth that people are excited for it/it has street cred? Or is it almost always you/PR person having to explain the concept over and over again? (Your PR person deserves a metal btw for convincing all these celebrities to participate and even finding ways to contact them.) My only other question(s) would be in regards to the lack of women guests; do you find they are less interested in participating? Or have the male guests just been easier to coordinate/book? Not a question, but I would love to see a duo of women (Key and Peele played off each other so well that was one of my favorite episodes)- maybe Tina Fey and Amy Pohler or Abbi and Ilana from Broad City. Thanks! P.s. as a vegetarian, 1. I still am obsessed with your show and 2. respect for making veggie wings for Ricky and others.
Can you get Barack on?
Big fan of the show, keep up the good work Sean!   If you could have anyone on the show, dead or alive, who'd it be?

does space have a smell?  I once heard it described as burnt chocolate chip cookies. 
My question would be, how was it to sleep in space?
Scott! Thank you so much for doing this. I loved watching your journey through space (I'm a longtime twitter follower).   What was your favorite place on earth to look down at from above? 
How soon do you predict space tourism will become a reality for the masses? 
In what ways did the earth looked different after you came back from your longest mission? Did the extended stay in space made the current events unfolding on earth look meager?
What would you recommend for a 40 year old, non science person do to be involved in this revived interest in space exploration?
Do you ever try to put objects down mid air forgetting there's gravity?
Scott, It's been a dream of mine from childhood to venture into Space. I'll probably not get the chance to do that as life took me to a different route. I'd just love to say thanks for the things you've put your mind and body through in the hopes of dragging us closer to the stars.  My question is, with private space companies now popping up, such as Space X, Blue Origin, etc. Do you think that they'll leapfrog NASA and other public space programs or does it seem more from your knowledge that it would be more of a level playing field with information sharing?
Living for a whole year in space truly is an amazing feat. You take of how science affects our daily lives. What are some of the processes and technologies of space and space travel that are already affecting us today?   And what is your opinion companies taking over future space programs such as space X, as opposed to having only government run programs?
Star Wars or Star Trek (or something else)? 
Surely, you know lots of people want to become astronauts. What about you made you the right candidate in the eyes of your supervisors? 
Is breaking wind 10x worse in a space suit?
I was fortunate enough to attend your lecture in Hutchinson.  I was wondering if you got the opportunity to tour the Cosmosphere while you were there?  If so, did you enjoy it?
With the tense international tensions and the ISS close to retirement, what do you think the near future will be in manned space exploration? 
Does space debris have an often impact on the ISS? 
Thank you Commander Kelly for doing this!  I am a biologist studying exercise and circadian rhythms in particular how exercise can change circadian rhythm in the skeletal muscle. I am also a big fan of space flight. As astronaut on board the ISS, you see 16 sunrises and sunsets per day the work schedule is tight and you probably have changing sleeping schedules in a never really dark environment   How much do you feel the effect of circadian disruption that comes along with the challenges of living and working in space?  Is there anything that you do to cope with the effects caused by circadian disruption such as sleeping problems, reduced alertness and concentration.?   Since your return from space do you appreciate a good night sleep on regular basis more than before? 
Welcome, and congrats on all you've done! Where would you really like to see space exploration take us in the coming years?"

This memeguy is so legendary, he's a legendary card in Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft.   [Leeroy Jenkins](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/media/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/thumb/6/6c/Leeroy_Jenkins%28674%29_Gold.png/200px-Leeroy_Jenkins%28674%29_Gold.png?version=9c84ba5b6b42e1d222d52aef09f26594) 
Here’s some answers to your questions:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvXRcwcIJh4
Not that guy, but we have a similar name, so I'll answer your questions.  1- I feel like Michael Bolton in OfficeSpace.   **Why should I change my name? He's the one that sucks.**  2- I'm not that guy, and it was scripted/made up for laughs.  3- I just kept doing the same thing I've always been doing. You know, playing Starcraft2, a little hearthstone, some overwatch, heroes of the storm. Fallout 1/2/3/4  4- Never played Wow. Played UO in beta, got into evercrack/levelquest but learned my lesson about MMORPGs.. avoided playing WoW  5- I play all the games! Haven't had a chance to play dark souls series, but I own it.. i think i need the right controller. Still haven't finished Last of Us, but I did finish BoTW  Send me your game suggestions!

Please announce legacy servers tomorrow. I had so much fun on  Elysium. It was everything I wanted and was great. People who say ""you don't want vanilla"" are wrong. I judge what is fun to me. I played late into legion but never really enjoyed it. My sub is canceled currently. I'm sure ill be back for the next xpac but im sure it won't last. Vanilla would keep me way longer or even tbc. Does that appeal to the masses? Dont know, dont care.  Just want to play what i loved on a legit no drama server 
One time, while on a long drive with my dad and brother. We started chanting the song ""Leeeeeeroy jenkins, Luh luh luh, luh luh luh luh leeeeeeeeroy. Leroy spankins, Luh luh luh, luh luh luh luh leeeeeeeeroy"" Until my dad was broken and started yellow. How does this make you feel?

I'm a social studies teacher and I use your Crash Course videos all the time. I know you've got like a dozen different Crash Course series going on right now. So my questions are:  * How involved are you in the Crash Course program now? Are you mostly handing them off to other experts to design and host?  * Are there any plans to bring back the defunct Crash Course Geography series? (Props, by the way, for owning up to the first episode's flaws and pulling the series.)   * Do you have plans to extend any more of your series like you did with the second season of World History?

Hi John,  Often in your vlogbrothers videos you express opinions and ideas to your audience. As a young teenager I found these videos to be instrumental to my growth as a human being.   Have you ever found your opinions or viewpoints on a subject change after making the video? Are there any old vlogbrothers videos you wish you could go back and remake with a more mature opinion?   Thank you and dftba! 
In your time living in Indianapolis, it's gone through some major changes, as have you. As a resident of Indy, what are some good changes you've seen? What are some negative changes to the city? And how has Indianapolis influenced you as a person?  Also have you ever eaten at Love Handle at 10th and Rural? That's currently my favorite place in the city and I hope it continues to do well when it moves to the Mass Ave neighborhood this November-ish.  See you next week! 🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢  Kiwi and Kiwi,  Chris

Hey John, I've been a long time fan, I started watching Vlogbrothers in 2008 and still pop in from time to time to see what's new. Is it ever strange to you that the people who started watching you in the beginning are grown ups now with their own lives? Do you think your audience changes every few years?

Some questions Reddit users might have to H Jon Benjamin are:,"I started watching Parks and Rec and it was weird to recognise a person by their voice before their appearance.

I loved reading, er, listening to your new book in audiobook format. When I was finished, I was saddened to find that this is the only book you've ever narrated. Any plans to narrate more books in your awesome voice? What genre of book besides autobiography would you be interested in doing?
Will you be mad at me if I just borrow the book from the library instead of paying real dollars to own it?
If ARCHER was made into live-action, would you consider voice over-ing the lead (Jon Hamm)?  Kind of like a Milo and Otis situation.  I think you may be too handsome to play live-action Sterling... 
After watching the Home Movies marathon on Twitch last week, I was reminded of how great that show was, and the improv was a part of why it is so good. Are there any crazy improv moments from the show that got cut/ made you break character ? I know that was a long time ago, but any antidotes about Home Movies would be rad. Have a great day dude :)
Personality wise, are you more like Bob or Archer? You just do Archer so well it seems effortless.  Also, is Woodhouse ever coming back, or did he fetch his last rug?
Can there be a Dr. Katz reboot? Please and thank you.
Was that episode of Bob’s Burgers where Gene sleeps over at a kids house from school inspired by the sleepover experience you talked about in your book? 
Hey John, what has been your favorite love scene to film?
Yes hello Mr. Jon Benjamin. Let's talk. Who do you think was a more successful failure? Archer or Bob? And how can we learn to fail as badly good as these guys do?
Why did you not list the doctor from Not Another Teen Movie too??  Who writes Archer's character? Some of the funniest, freshest lines on TV. Huge fan!
if you could, would you go back and change anything about *jon benjamin has a van*? that show was one of my first forays into alternative comedy. big fan!

Are you having more freedom to do stuff at the new show than at top gear?

How happy are you that the phrase ""Oh, cock"" has entered the lexicon?
James! Were you ever the stig, actually?

Thanks for doing the AMA. Not a huge fan, but I still respect your career.  I'm not being snarky when I ask this, I'm seriously curious.  Was the whole purity ring thing a part of your marketing to families and young kids. Or were you seriously about abstaining from gettin' down and it was just publicized to give you guys a cleaner image?  Did you just bail on it once a bunch fine women started throwing themselves at you? Or you still trying to be pure and whatnot?  I'm just trying to understand because you should be able pull like Leo no problem.    
Hey Nick,  Thanks for doing this AMA, love your music. Do you have a favorite gas station snack?
Hey, Nick! I've been Type One for almost 13 years and my question is how do you cope with it now, compared to when you were a kid?

Hello Daniel, I always laugh hard from your scream in Home Alone. Out of all the traps set in Home Alone, which one was your favorite?
what is your favorite restaurant to eat at? will you also be getting drunk for christmas?
The scream. The one with the tarantula. Was that real? If so, how? 
Hi Daniel!!  At what point did you realise the film (Home Alone) had become a Christmas movie juggernaut and did you ever expect the appeal to last as long as it has?   
Hi Daniel,  My favorite film of yours was Very Bad Things where you killed that hooker named Tina and tried to cover it up. Bravo. What's your favorite and why?
How much difference is acting on set compared to voice-acting?   Loved you as Dilbert. :)
Hey,  thanks for coming to Reddit. Enjoy your stay.   Something that has always puzzled me: Did you ever get an injury from home alone?  If so how bad was it?
Not home alone related, but I loved you in City Slickers.  Did any of you get to keep the calf?
Hey! What is/are your favorite movie(s) of all time?
Hello Daniel,  I wanted to ask what the most fun you've had on a set was? Which movie can you look back on and remember filming it fondly?
I don't know which was a funnier role from you in my childhood--Marv in Home Alone or Brickma in Rookie of the Year.  But in a no-holds-barred arm wrestling contest, who do you think wins?
Hi! Congrats on having a long and memorable career. Among your many films is Rookie of the Year. Do you have any fun memories of doing that movie? Again, congrats and happy holidays. 
Hey Daniel! Merry Christmas.  I read on IMDb that Joe Pesci deliberately avoided Macaulay Culkin while on-set because Pesci wanted him to think he was mean. Did you do the same thing, or were you more friendly towards Macaulay?
What are you doing for Christmas and New Years?   
Was it fun to hang out on set with the guys from workaholics when you played Travis Rockne?   
Hi Dan, big Fan. Was it tough recovering from becoming a [skeleton](http://i.imgur.com/ZrZgONM.jpg) during your role in Home Alone 2?

Hi Ron.  Back in 2009, after a party at the Playboy Mansion there was an after-party at the Roosevelt Hotel. You stumbled into our hotel room when our door was open. You ended up hanging out for hours drinking with us and taking my friends 1 by 1 into the bathroom so they could ""see it."" Then you wrote me down your email address and asked me to send you all the pics I took and you would send me a DVD in return.  I never got my DVD... what the crap?!   Follow-up question: What all happened in that bathroom with my friends?  Proof: http://imgur.com/a/3aGMY

* If we bring jobs back from China, how will US business maintain 'healthy' profit margins with increased overheads?   * If we get into a 'trade war' with China, as you seem to be implying, how will American businesses be able to grow their markets?  * How do you intend to compel Mexico, a sovereign state, to finance the construction of a wall it doesn't want?  * Do you really feel personal insults belong in the kind of dialogues a man who seeks to represent *all* the citizens of the US should be having?  * What are your thoughts on the US healthcare system?  * What are your thoughts on US intervention in middle eastern conflicts?  * How do you intend to secure US energy needs for the future?  * What are your thoughts on privatization of the prison system?  * What are your thoughts on student debt in the US?   * What are your thoughts on the need to do more to improve and maintain infrastructure in the US?  ...just off the top of my head.

Some questions Reddit users might have to Scott Kelly are:,"Do you and the the other crew members play any space pranks on each other?   EDIT: In hindsight I should have also asked what those pranks were.
Why do you always have your arms folded?
Hi Scott, thanks for doing this AMA. Could you tell us something unusual about being in space that many people don't think about?
Being up in space for an entire year is a LONG time. Have you noticed any effects on your body from weightlessness? Are your plans for recovery once you're back on earth more intensive than traditional programs for other astronauts who only go up for shorter time periods?
Hello Scott, Would it be possible for you to photograph the planets all in alignment over the next 2 weeks and post on FB and Twitter? I'd love to see them from your standpoint in space. Thanks. :) 
What's it like to sleep in 0G? It must be great for the back. Does the humming of the machinery in the station affect your sleep at all?
Hey up there!! What does zero G feel like on your body when you are just hanging out? Does it make your eyes open a little bit wider, or anything like that?? Thank you so much for your dedication to the advancement of human space exploration. 
So weird, just thinking 2 days ago whether or not you've had an AMA because I wanted ask the following question:  What are the cardiovascular effects of longterm space travel?  Is your blood pressure lower?    Thank you and I love your Instagram 
How are you doing this AMA? Are you directly typing it from a laptop on the ISS, or are is it being dictated?  What do you suppose the chances are of us getting to mars any time soon?
Do you ever have disagreements/arguments on board with the other crew, and if so what is it usually about? 
Mr. Kelly, what is the largest misconception about space/space travel that society holds onto?
What ONE thing will you forever do differently after your safe return home?
This is so great! 1.How do you regulate your sleep cycles? 2.How heavy is your space suit? and last, 3. How well have you adjusted to keeping social relationships while away? Will you have transitioning issues with this when you return home?
Hi Scott! Thanks for doing this interview today.  My Question: What is like to work with members of other nations space programs? Do the poltics that take place on Earth affect your relationship with them?
Hello Commander Kelly!  I love star gazing, but sometimes it is difficult for me to do it from where I live. I bet observing Earth must be astounding, but it shouldn't be different from observing the universe, right? Do you like star gazing? How is it from the ISS? What about the shooting stars?  I love your work! Cheers.  Efraim Rodrigues.  
We are big fans of yours!  I watched the livestream of the spacewalk last year- amazing.  Does everything seem to take a really long time or do you get used to that?  What would you like to see the next president do for the space program?  And how often do you get to talk to your brother and daughters?
Happy 302 days in space!  And thank you for doing this AMA from space!  So cool!  I have two main questions; first question inspired by [The Martian](https://goo.gl/qDS9De) and character Mark Watney's mission length.  1.  Upon completing your 1 year in space, if the offer was on the table, would you do a 2 year space mission in the future?  And why?  Would it depend on the mission (Moon, Mars, ISS again)?  2. Can you describe your sleep cycle over the last 300 days in space?  Always a solid 8 hours?  Did you ever get strangely tired or have you consistently felt well rested?  Bonus Question:  When sleeping, is your dream world mostly in zero-G?
How the connectivity from up there?
Hi Cmdr Kelly! I am dad to a couple of boys who are very much into space and astronaut work. Here are their two astronaut questions:   Peter (7yrs old): How long does it take to get used to being in space?  Simon (5yrs): Could a rogue spaceship sneak up on the space station without you being aware, and dock?
Hi, I'm a Kindergarten Teacher. My students and I have been following you since you went up last year. My past and present students are curious; what kind of things do you do for fun?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Daryl Davis are:,"From your experience, do you still believe everyone can change or have you met some who are too far gone?
You mentioned that some of your views are described as controversial. Would you mind writing about that?   Which views of your have been described that way and why and what shaped them?   Thank you
Hi Daryl. I am an educator, specifically a high school history teacher, and I believe that education is the key to helping people understand one another. With only a limited amount of time at my disposal, what would you say are the best ways to help educate people and help them develop empathy for one another? Any tips, tricks, specific paths that you lean towards? Thanks!
You've been doing this a long time. What have you learned about yourself that you hope you never forget?
Do you think such an approach could work as a project (ish) for masses of people? Or would that create a ""pretend to listen because everyone is watching"" situation. I'm thinking the likes of talks between Palestinians and Israeli; big city ethnic problems and such.
Since you cant be everywhere at once converting klan members. Do you think there could ever be some kind of community program that could educate young kids and keep them away from the klan? Would something like that work why or why not?
Hi Daryl - thanks for all the work you're doing in this field. I wanted to ask what is your opinion of how you think things have changed in regards to racism from when you started until now. What differences (if any) are you seeing in language, the type of people, and their actions? Thanks for taking the time to answer my question, and take care!
Have you ever had people you have talked to and get them to turn away from racism, only for them to become racist again later?
If you encounter someone being racist publicly to someone else, doesn't matter their race, how would you proceed?
During your prime of converting members of the Ku Klux Klan, did you ever have any moments where you truly feared for your life and/or thought you made a huge mistake going somewhere members were present?
I'm a huge fan of what you do, you're truly an inspiration to us all.  But I'd like to know who your musical inspirations were growing up, and what do you love listening to today?
Hi Daryl,  Do Klu Klux Klan members have a deep fear towards black people or non-white people altogether? I've always thought in the back of my mind that's the root of there hatred. From your experiences can you confirm this?
I watched your Ted Talk from a few years ago and have been a huge fan ever since. I have a tremendous amount of respect for you. My question is: what is your opinion on the BLM organization? Do any of their goals or ideologies resonate with you? Are there any tactics or goals of theirs that you disagree with?
Hi Daryl. I find your work extremely inspiring. What tips do you have for maintaining a dialog across ideological lines? Do you think social media can be a way of having those conversations or are they best held face to face?
Love the work that you do and loved your podcast appearance on Joe Rogan.  What is the best way you have found to garner empathy and establish communication with people that are so polar opposite to you?
Hi Daryl, I just want to say thank you for all that you do and the message and mentality you promote. Have you ever considered doing a podcast or video series of your own? I'd imagine most of the people you talk to wouldn't be on board with being recorded, but maybe with some of the higher profile members of society like politicians or group leaders? Thanks again and keep being you.
Hello good sir! Would you be/are you opposed to black supremacy movements, such as Farrakhan's group?   I am a big fan of your work, and very impressed how you have managed to have people with hate turn from their ways. Keep up the good work!
As a black man with no ill will towards anyone, I still can’t wrap my head around what you do. I respect it and admire the courage involved but I wonder, what keeps you motivated to keep going forward when there are so many that question the purpose and goal of your work?
Do you get discouraged having to solve racism one person at a time?  There seem to be millions of racists and you can never get to them all with more popping up all the time.  It just seems so daunting and I'm wondering how you motivate yourself.

Some questions Reddit users might have to Charlie Duke are:,"Where is the *second* most remarkable place you've ever walked?
You've previously told a story about [screwing around on the moon](https://bgr.com/2019/06/28/charlie-duke-moon-story-apollo/) and potentially almost breaking your life-support systems when you landed badly.  How does it feel knowing you probably hold the record for highest moon jump, and have for almost fifty years?
I have a bit of a technical question that I've always wondered about. How did you sleep on the moon? Was there enough room to lay down on the floor of the LEM or were there hammocks or something that you would hang up?
Other than the Corvettes the astronauts were supplied with, what other kinds of perks did provided to NASA employees at that time?   Were there ever personal problems between crew members or ground staff that threatened the success of the mission?
What was your first thought when stepping onto the moon?
Charlie, I had the pleasure to sit and talk with you at a college luncheon about 35 years ago. I remember discussing your ride on the lunar rover. Anything you can share about your off-roading experience?

Good morning Sir,  I wanna know if CAPCOM had small talk with the crew, conversations which were not recorded for posterity?  Thank you Mr Duke
What was the scariest part of the missions?
Hello Mr. Duke,  What is one thing you learned about yourself while carrying out the mission?
Hi Charlie, I listened to the BBC podcast “13 Minutes to the Moon” and they played your CAPCOM loop uninterrupted for the final 13 minutes of Apollo 11’s descent. How scary were the comm and data drop outs and how did your heart rate compare with Neil’s?
What was your path of education that lead you to where you are now?
How do you respond to folks who deny the reality of the mission?
What was the most fun thing you did on the moon?
What is the view like from on the moon? On a documentary I watched last night, the astronauts described the view as pitch black. Could you not see stars/the earth whilst on the moon?   Thank you!
Thank you for doing this AMA. Would a citizen or amateur radio operator have been able to listen to real time communications during the missions back then? Just curious, as I know it would be bad if someone started transmitting on those allocated frequencies.
What do you think of space tourism? What is even considered 50 years ago?

Hey Charlie, if a Mars trip had come up during the 70s (either fly by or landing) would you have gone on it?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Richard King are:,"The most memorable moment for me in Dunkirk was when the plane crashes into the sea and there is super loud ""CRACK."" It was exhilerating in the theater to hear because I think we are conditioned in movies to always hear a low ""boom"" no matter what the collision on the screen is.  How did you get that sound and was it a conscious  effort to try and make it sound that way?   Also, how do you approach dynamic range to get such loud explosions or other sound effects? Do you run into any limitations and how do you handle them?  Thank you, I love your work and you are a huge inspiration!
What was the best sound ""accident"" you had? Thanks!
Hi Richard! This is amazing, thank-you for taking the time.   I'm really intrigued about the gun sounds in Dunkirk. They sound like no other movie - I saw the movie quite a few times on 70mm and the mix was staggering. Aggressive, harsh, with this almost terrifying quality to them that has a very visceral feel and emotional response. How did you achieve that sound? Did you approach them in a different way to the way you'd usually cut weapons in a film? to me, they had something of a 'raw' feeling to them. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thanks again!
   Hi Richard! Thanks so much for doing this. I have two related questions:  &#x200B;  1. I often find vehicle design to be challenging, especially when there are lots of different camera angles and perspective cuts. What are some tips for getting vehicles to feel consistent? 2. Do you ever have to sound design for shots that are still in pre-viz? If so, what are some good strategies for preventing wasted work?
What was the toughest scene you ever worked on? Was it because of the multitude of sounds required to produce the right audio or because it was tought to decide on the best representation for a particular...something?
Mr. King!  Thanks for doing this!  Something I'm always interested in is when a scene will utilize a *lack* of sound to accentuate the other noises that are happening and establish tension or wonder.  I think of films like *No Country for Old Men* and *Wall-E*.  How do you go about crafting a scene in which there is ""no sound?""  What techniques do you use to capture the perfect ambient room tone and ensure that the subtle noises that are happening are accentuated to the degree they need to be?  Is most everything added afterward?  Is it a mix of both?  Thank you again, and I hope you have a great day!
Hi Richard! Thank you so much for taking the time to do this.  In a past Soundworks Collection video (I think for Inception) I remember you describing the process of stacking the separate moments of a recorded gunshot, placing the gunshot itself, the whiz by and impact all on top of each other. This creates an impossible sound that could never be heard in real life.  It seems like this is one of those moments in filmmaking where a subtly unrealistic approach results in an almost more realistic sounding track, possibly to due audience expectations built through decades of ""movie magic"".  Off the top of your head, can you think of any other instances like this where a creative and ""unrealistic"" design approach results in a more effectively perceived sense of realism by the audience?  Thanks again for doing this! No doubt this thread will be used as high quality inspiration material for a lot of people.
Is it me, or has the dynamic contrast between dialogue and action scenes gotten worse in movies over the years (i.e. dialogue scenes being noticeably quieter than action scenes)?    If it's not just me, then what do you suppose is driving this increase in dynamic contrast?
What was your experience like shifting from working with analog machines to digital ones? I assume there were some pros and cons, and I would live to hear how your experience shaped your current approach to sound design.   Also, is there a specific plugin (or type of plugin) that you find yourself coming back to again-and-again?  As a sound editor early in my career, thank you for the endless inspiration!
Do you have a list a favorite films sound design wise?
Thanks for taking the time to do this!  I've seen a number of young sound designers torn between focusing on creating/utilizing their own sound effects libraries for projects (which ends up taking a ton of time and can often times be of lower quality than intended) , and using entirely canned sound effects for their projects (which can result in over manipulation and an unnatural sounding product). Where do you find the balance for creators on a budget? And with this in mind, how can someone utilize the library you just released effectively? Would you be able to go into some more detail on what the library has to offer?
Hi Richard, all of us who love our jobs and dedicate a big portion of our time seem to struggle with work life balance. Do you still go through the same struggles? Do you have any tips on achieving full attention to work and our loved ones?
This is AMAZING!   Hi Richard. When it comes to sound design, I run all of my audio through to a group channel. On that group I have an EQ with a low cut at 35Hz and then a brichwall limiter for all the big explosions and sounds like that. Is this correct or would you suggest something different?
Could you comment on your sound design process? Specially thinking outside the box when it comes to sound editing? I often find myself being too literal about what's on the screen!
Since the 2000s, does it seem like Hollywood has lost interest in immersive surround sound? It seems that there are only a few movies released nowadays that actually dedicate some creative energy into crafting an excellent surround sound experience.  Also, how much say do directors have in how the film is to be mixed? Is a lot of the creative control in your hands and they let you play around with it? Thanks!
How do you approach making objects feel immense in size, like giant ships or explosions,  without just turning the volume up? Do you worry about headroom and the mix in your design process, or are you more focused on choices and sound creation?
In the film Dunkirk during the Stuka's dive bombing beach scene, would you have preferred to have used the historical high pitched scream rather than the deep roar that was used in the film?
Hi Richard! Thank you for taking your time to answer our questions!     After enough projects concluded, have you challenged yourself into recreating your workflow process? Or the sound you would normally go to as a first instinct? How do you deal with process of starting a new project and still keep a fresh new perspective.
Why does Christopher Nolan tend to have some dialogue drowned out in favour of loud music or sound effects?  As a film geek, and a music/sound fan, this drives me absolutely crazy and does a major disservice to his, and your, work.
How did you come up with sounds for the 4D space in Interstellar? I imagine that scene was hard to put yourself into the characters shoes."
Some questions Reddit users might have to Guillermo del Toro are:,"I have always loved the color palettes of you films! How did you come up with colors for pacific rim? i.e. the beautiful blue from inside of the kaujis

I am a huge fan of your work, thank you for taking the time to do this!! Couple Questions: Any Hellboy 3 details you can share?! A lot of your films largely use practical effects and makeup instead of CGI. While, from what I’ve heard, CGI can be more cost effective and quicker, they can sometimes take me out of the experience. Practical effects always make the characters feel like they are more real and seem more detailed while on screen. A good example of this would be the comparison of CGI Bolg(left) to practical Bolg(right) from “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug” seen here: http://www.thelandofshadow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BolgvsBolg.jpg I was curious what your thoughts were on where the industry is headed in terms of special effects and the large shift towards CGI? 
Hello Mr. Del Toro, I'm a big anime fan and I was impressed with your Pacific Rim movie, which shows some influence from japanese mecha series like Evangelion. I could say it was a first time when I saw well done mecha live-action movie. I'm sure upcoming sequel will be top notch too. I wonder if that franchise success, and also good reception of recently released Edge of Tomorrow movie, will push forward some anime/manga live-action adaptations.  I'm both excited and frightened by such perspective, since japanese culture that influenced those series is nothing like what Hollywood is used to. I'm quite excited through about possible Monster adaptation, that I heard you was collaborating with. So now some questions:  - are there any news about Monster that you could share with us?  - is there any manga or anime series that you are familiar with, that you would be interested in adapting into movie if given a chance?
You're know for having insects pop up a lot in your films, is there a particular reason for that?

Big fan!  What drew you to directing and who plays the biggest influence on you?
Hi!  First of all thank you so much for taking the time to answer our questions. You are one of my favorite directors so you cannot imagine my excitement when I heard that you were planning on doing an AMA. Obviously there are a lot of questions that I could ask so I decided to narrow it down to three.   Firstly, one of the many reasons I am such a fan of your films is because of your eye for monsters. Now I know that you have always been intrigued by monsters, but do you have any idea as to why this is?  What is your favorite monster and why?  Lastly, I know that you have expressed interest in a Justice League Dark movie. As a huge fan of the comics, I was wondering if there are any characters that you are particularly interested in adapting.   Thanks again!
How is the ""Justice League Dark"" film coming along? 
Hi Guillermo,  You're a favorite director of mine, mainly because your characters are all so varied in their ways. If you could make a film featuring just ONE of your characters who would it be?  Thank you!  P.S Who would win a fight between Ron Perlman and Doug Jones?

Some questions Reddit users might have to Ian Anderson are:,"Thank you so much for all the music, Mr. Anderson! I have one question regarding the footage of Jethro Tull’s 1978 Madison Square Garden concert: at the end of Locomotive Breath, going into Dambusters March, you are seen twirling your flute with great flair and then, before heading to grab the big balloons, you appear to toss the flute towards the audience! Was this a magic trick, some sleight of hand? Or was that flute really thrown? The fate of that flute has been on my mind for years!
Hello Ian, Did you keep a diary back in the early days of your career? What are the chances of you writing an autobiography?
 Hello Mr Anderson, I am thrilled to see you here… I was wondering if you had any stories you recollect concerning my favourite song of yours, Jack in the Green. I have read somewhere that you composed it just in a few hours alone in the studio, playing all the instruments by yourself. Is it true? Greetings from Portugal and I hope to see you in my country in a concert in the future!
My second question is as what are some of Ian Anderson’s favorite books and authors?!
 Do you remember your first musical memory and or the first record you ever bought for yourself?
Broadford Bazaar Question-. As a Tull fan who is 30 years old my favorite period of your music has always been the trio of “Songs from the Wood, Stormwatch and Heavy Horses” albums . “Broadford Bazaar” is a pretty obscure Tull track that never made it on to an album at the time, but I’ve always loved it so much, can you tell any backstory about the writing/recording of the song Ian? With the Stormwatch 2 record store day release I was overjoyed to finally be able to have this song on vinyl so thank you!

 In 50+ years, when people think or mention of Jethro Tull, what do you want for you and the band to be remembered for?
There was a lot of controversy when Jethro Tull won the Grammy in 1989 for Hard Rock beating out Metallica  Have you ever discussed the outcry that followed with any of the guys from Metallica?  This many years on do you feel more comfortable with that win?
Plans for any more cathedral concerts? I had the deep joy of seeing you at Worcester a few years ago with Lloyd Grossman, Marc Almond and your son in law. My daughter was 6 and fell asleep during Aqualung (I'm still working on her).
Hi Ian!   Couldn't bring myself to choose between two questions:  1. Lots of Tull music is in unusual or ever-shifting time signatures. How often is that a desire to rhythmically spice things up VS coming up with a rhythm in a song and then discovering that it's completely wonky? I'm far from implying that one approach is better than the other, just wondering how it actually happens with your composing process.  2. The vinyl pressing of Roots to Branches is these days absurdly rare and precious. Are there plans to repress it one day? Maybe a remastered version?     That album holds a special place in my heart, being maybe the first ""official"" cassette release I saw in my life back in '95, with that spectacular lyrics fold-out and all. No idea how that tape managed to survive, given the number of times I played it in a Walkman on my way to school.   Thanks and cheers from Ukraine! Came to Kyiv for both of your most recent shows.
are the facial expressions on command or do they come naturally?
    Hi Mr. A, any new stuff upcoming? Musically I Mean…
what’s your favorite hobby besides touring, playing the flute, or any instrument for that matter?
So if I may ask, what exactly happened with Martin Barre? The real deal, not the politically correct version.  Thank you.
Hi Ian!  Keith here.  Which song on Aqualung do you enjoy performing 50 years later?
Hello Mr. Anderson!  I Have been a lifelong fan of your work, and you’re likely one of the reasons Prog Rock is my all time favourite genre. My question is what made JT decide to to switch from being a Blues Rock band to be a Prog band? Was it the emergence of bands like King Crimson and ELP?  Thank you very much for this wonderful opportunity!  Ps. Bonus question seeing as it’s officially the 5th anniversary of his unfortunate passing. In a Prog  Magazine interview, Keith Emerson stated that you were his music hero. What do you think about that? Thank you again, I really appreciate it!
Is there any song you wish you hadn't written? One that got popular but you realized later that you didn't like very much?

Where did you learn / come up with the breathing method you mention in TATWD for dealing with anxiety? The Candle Method  my fiancé wanted to thank you for putting the breathing method in Turtles All the Way Down.

Was there an essay you liked that didn’t make the final cut of the book?
If you could create a new Crash Course series on any one topic, purely for your own interest and with no concerns for deadlines, budget, or other minutiae, what is something you'd love to do a deep dive on?
There’s a chapter where you talk about loving the world and how loving the world isn’t “to ignore or overlook suffering,” which is one of my favorite parts of the book. I’ve felt that was true for a long time, but was never able to put it into words or make it feel right.  I work at a children’s hospital and (although not as a chaplain!) and see a lot of tragedy, I’m in nursing school during a pandemic, I have sometimes-debilitating mental health and health diagnoses. But I also have the greatest friends in the world. I have a dog I love more than anything. I have pretty hikes and sights just down the road.   How were you able to be comfortable with loving the world despite the parts of it that make it hard to love? Do you have advice on how to fall in love with the world while recognizing its flaws and actively wanting to help make the world better for everyone?
Will there be more Crash Courses with you as a host? I really enjoyed learning about European and World History from you!
Why were the seed potatoes of Leningrad omitted from the book?  I was all set to cry my eyes out again. It was such a powerful story I was surprised it didn't make the cut.

Since you're continuing the podcast will there ever be a second Anthropocene reviewed book or is this it?
Who do you use in Mario Kart?
If you're famous for anything it's for being terrible at coming up with first drafts of book titles. Where there any examples for The Anthropocene Reviewed (either the pod or the book)?
Can I just say thank you? Youtube was always a much happier place to be while growing up, mostly due to you and Hank and nerdfighteria in general.
Hello John, you and Hank kind of played the role of auxiliary parents to me and many young people at Nerdfighteria. Who would you attribute that role to in your life, if you had to?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Scott Kelly are:,"Was it strange to be back on earth with earth smells and earth people?

Hi Scott, thanks for the AMA.  How was getting used to life back on earth after one year aboard the ISS? What was something you had to ""learn"" again?
The graph of human health vs prolonged exposure to gravity level only has two data points: one at microgravity and one at 1 gravity. Do you think even small amounts of gravity would help greatly offset the negative health effects of microgravity? For example, would astronauts on the Moon (in 1/6 gravity) fare much better than ISS astronauts do?

Some questions Reddit users might have to Jill Stein are:,"Why doesn't the green party focus more on local races? We see countless times that a party doesn't succeed by winning the Presidency/PM first but by winning local seats and growing.

Hi Dr. Stein,  Your advocacy for *ranked-choice voting* got me to look into different methods of voting. As it turns out, ranked-choice has its issues, too, and there are other methods which are better. Would you consider advocating for *score* or *approval voting*?
Dr. Stein, does your opposition to nuclear energy extend to nuclear fusion? There has been some very promising research into new reactor technologies in this decade, and new high beta rate reactors by Lockheed-Martin are expected to reach prototype phase in the next few years.

Dr. Stein, What are your thoughts on a Basic Income as a means to combat poverty?   Also, Have you approached Bernie Sanders other than that letter about possibly joining Bernie Sanders? And your thoughts on Arn Meneconi the Green Party candidate running for US Senate in Colorado?
Hi Jill! With the polarizing nature of the current Democratic and Republican candidates, this coming election will attract a lot of new voters to alternative parties. How do you plan on maintaining the momentum that the Green party will achieve over the rest of the election season?
Hey Jill, just wondering what your stance on recreational marijuana is? 
Dr. Stein,  How do you respond to people who see your candidacy as Nader-2000-esque? Looking more for the short-term immediate response (as in, are you helping Trump be elected THIS CYCLE) rather than the long-term but still important moralistic response (we need to end the Two Party system!), if that response exists within our current political system.

Do you think something like marijuana legalization would be a viable less harmful alternative for those not looking for mental health counseling?  Thanks again and keep up the fight for 50 (ballots).
Why do you accept your party's stances on homeopathy and alternative medicine? Don't you feel as a former professional in the medical field that these alternative treatments are harmful to the health of patients, except in the rare instances where they act as placebos?

""The trick to education is to teach people in such a way that they don't realize they're learning until it's too late"" - Herald Egerton  Is that your mantra when you release a new video on Vsauce now/after you made the Ted Talks, or has it always been what you were trying to do?

Anyway, if you’re ever in Boston and feel like catching up/shooting the shit I’m sure he’d love to see you and would probably shit his pants if you showed up.

Some questions Reddit users might have to John Oliver are:,"Holy shit he bought the list from Texas. The only things on my credit report are medical debts! I wonder how I find out if my debt was bought? If anyone has any ideas I'll look into it. 
How about an AMA from [rolling jubilee,](http://rollingjubilee.org/) instead? They're the Occupy Wall Street-related group that has been buying debt and forgiving it like this for several years and has so far abolished $31,982,455.76 in debt and that anyone can get involved with by donating.  EDIT: f.y.i., there's currently an old, dead sub that seems to be dedicated to this: [/r/rollingjubilee](https://www.reddit.com/r/rollingjubilee). People who are interested should subscribe to it, and perhaps begin making overtures to the old organizers of this campaign letting them know people are interested in this type of activism.
So this is probably stupid but couldn't a bunch of people get together and buy their own debt, and reduce their payments by a massive margin. Like 10,000 people get a pool of money held in escrow buy the debt back at a fraction and settle all of their debts in one swoop.   I feel like I could have just broken the system, or there is some painfully obvious government bullshit rule to stop this from happening?
Sooooo....who wants to pay off my student loans?
Didn't he say the debt was outside of the statute of limitations? If so the  these people really had no true legal obligation to pay. I used to work in collections for on of these types of companies, subsidiary type ""law firm""  for square two, and the goal there was to make people pay so the statute was renewed or lengthened then sue them. As I understood it once it's outside of statutes they're essentially off Scott free.   Worked at this place for about 6 months after moving across the country and it was the only job I could find at the time above minimum wage. It's seriously awful on the collector side if you have a conscience. 
Another question: Did you receive a 1099-C requiring you to pay taxes on the forgiven debt?
It was 9K people and $15M in total? That's only $1600 per person. If you didn't have the ability to pay that, you'd likely be poor enough to get state-sponsored health insurance.
These debts were all out of statute, right? So what he really saved the people from is the harassment they'd get from debt collectors, and then potentially falsely paying the debt?
What if instead of the ""let's make a millionaire"" sub, there was a ""let's forgive $15M in medical debt"" sub where people pooled like a buck a piece and raised $60k to do something like this?
Would it be possible for the 9000 to each chip in say, 5% of what was their debt, to buy up more debt cheaply, and forgive that round of debt, and for those people so affected to di likewise and keep this going until all the debt is extinguished?
I am curious who did you buy this package of debt FROM?
Will this impact taxes in any way?  Or is it considered a gift?  I know if a debt is forgiven, you have to claim it as income (barring some exceptions).  So if the person had no intention of paying, or thought it wasn't theirs, and then had it paid off, they can get a 1099 for the debt and they will owe taxes on it.  This may fall under one of the exemptions so i'm not entirely sure.
What if the creditor is incorrect and you don't really owe the debt.  Is there a way to dispute it, and actually prevail? 
I'm pretty sure the debt he acquired was beyond the statute of limitations wasn't it?
How come there isn't a kickstarter or charity to donate to that does this regularly?
This just takes a item of debut off of the debt buyers ecosystem and ends the money chain. If Bill Gates wanted to he could end a lot of the debt chains, or web, all at once. It mostly suffocates other debt buyers from having business. So if we could make the buyers starve in poverty instead of the millions of Americans they harass every year that would be a good thing... (right?)
Can someone please elaborate just what happened on the show? The video linked was 20 minutes and I'm just looking for a TL;DW
To all concerned, why don't you do this yourselves? Is it against the law to buy your own debt? Work around it and set up an independent company, which you crowd fund with just enough money to do what you want it to do and open up a donation stream from outsiders to receive more revenue. Sort of like a pyramid scheme but in reverse. You donate money to it, you get on this company's list of debts to be bought and forgiven. The order will be chronological, as people donate and enter their ""database"". To me it appears like a no brainer, if it's deregulated enough, there probably aren't any provisions against this. At the end of the day the previous debt holder will get paid.
A serious question. I always want to give to charity, but you never know where the money is really going. Could I buy someone's debt? Like a small scale action of what John Oliver did? I feel that the ROI fire charity is higher than for any other cause.
Did you understand what John Oliver actually did? He didn't forgive their debt. He bought the personal information of people whose debt was already past the statutory collection period (i.e. they didn't owe it any more). Essentially, for all intents and purposes, there debt was already written off and they owed nothing. Generally, debt collectors buy these for pennies on the dollar (this batch of $15 million was sold for roughly $60k, .4% of it's original value) and then attempt to collect the money (that's not really owed) through bully/scare tactics. JO just bought the information and didn't follow up with them to attempt collection."
Some questions Reddit users might have to Don Lewis are:,"What exactly did Don Lewis do for a living?  All I got from watching Tiger King was that he was independently wealthy, left the country for extended periods of time once a month, and nobody seemed to have a definitive answer for where his money comes from.  ...also, there’s an obvious overlap between the big cat collector community and the cocaine trafficking community.
I have seen rumors that Don Lewis was running drugs and was most likely killed because of those dealings.  Do you believe that is true?  Edit:  Fixed Don's last name.
Can this case be solved at this point without a confession from the murderer or the people who were involved?  I saved the link for reading later, thank you!
Based on what you know and who you have talked to, what does your gut say about this case?
Were you able to talk to Carol’s brother the cop, in your investigation? Do you think he plays a role in the disappearance of Don Lewis?
Do you think there's anything major that the show misrepresented about the story?
Hi everyone, there are numerous possible explanations to explain Don' disappearance if it's true Carole didn't murder him. One theory for instance, was that he was dumped out of a plane, potentially by someone who had borrowed money from him at some point. Does the team have any wild or favourite theories to explain his death/disappearance?   Additionally, does your team perhaps have any feeling or knowledge which may lead you towards believing that there are any individuals or organisations who are acting as road block's in the investigation?
Because of the popularity of Tiger King, do you find it harder to investigate? Harder to sift through the BS so to speak?
Is there anything that could be done now even if it is proven he was murdered since it was so long ago?
I saw an interview on YouTube with Kenny’s ex wife. Here she admits that Kenny at one point threatened to kill her ‘just like he Did with Don by putting her through a meat grinder’.   Next day she decided to dip from Kenny while taking the kids and move to an other state.   Kenny received a nice new pick up truck and some real estate shortly after Don’s death as well according to Kenny’s ex wife.   So the question is: have you seen it?  If not, the yt channels name is ripper jack media and the date of the video is April 3rd.  Would love to have your opinion on it.
Did Carole explain her rationale for taking the will out of the safe?
The article is quite exhaustive, it must have been a challenging piece to write. How did you manage sifting through so much information and put together a cohesive piece of journalism?

Can you talk for a moment how you pitched this investigation to your editors? Were they receptive? How long have you been working on this story?  May I also ask how do you question someone if you suspect they were involved in something negative or illegal without losing their trust or making them defensive? Conversely, how do you prevent being manipulated by an interviewee?
Did Don have a girlfriend in another country? Is so, we’re you able to speak with her?
What was the most surprising thing you found whilst you were investigating?

Some questions Reddit users might have to Ken Jennings are:,"Since they record jeopardy in runs, and are aired at such a delay, how did it feel when new contestants started to recognize you from the currently aired episodes?
For going on 15 years now, I have applied to appear on Jeopardy! every time the opportunity has been offered to me.  Still no appearances and I have never even received an invitation to audition.  Am I just a moronic stupidhead who will NEVER get an invitation, or is there some form of bribe/verbal threat/secret handshake that I need to know about to get that coveted invitation?
Hi Ken. What are the odds of you joining my trivia team for a night in Seattle? The same villainous team has been been winning for months on end and it would be oh-so-satisfying to see them lose.  I’ll buy you a beer, if that sweetens the pot.
Shouldn’t you be asking the questions?

I am very upset over the Watson episode.  It is often described that Jeopardy! pitted two champions against the Watson computer, but it isn't like you two were teamed up against Watson, it was a 3 way battle. The 2 of you were spliting the questions that Watson couldn't answer.  I am confident that either one of you alone could have beat Watson 1 vs 1.  You probably could have beat Watson if it was you and a typical Jeopardy contestant at the 3rd position.    Does that bother you as much as it bother me (probably not given your username), and why not?
What is FedEx?  Have you spoken to Nancy Zerg since that day?
What surprised you most about your time being on Jeopardy? 
Do you think the abundance of satire, in particular the Jon Stewart Daily Show, gave people a pressure release that prevented them from taking more proactive measures to address things in the world they don't like?

If you could be on another game show besides Jeopardy, what would it be and why?
I remember the episode that you didn't bet an amount for final Jeopardy that put you at an even number - what drove you to maddness?
Hi Ken!!  I have a question that I'm sure you've been asked a million and one times. I have a Jeopardy audition coming up in three weeks, and I'm SUPER excited about it. I also have a day job and a toddler, both of which preclude extensive studying time.   **My question: If you could only study 5 things while preparing for a Jeopardy audition, what would they be?**  (Not necessarily five categories/topics, although that works as well if there are any topics that you felt like were absolutely essential. I'm looking at studying category titles so that I can become better at word association/pre-guessing possible clues, studying the Pavlovs, etc. I'm also already working on practicing buzzer timing as much as I can.)  FWIW, I tend to be strong in literature, history, and geography. Not so strong in pop culture, music, opera, or Broadway.
Hey Ken! I am a huge fan of you and also a big fan of your podcast, Omnibus! Since your podcast is all about obscure topics, what was your favorite obscure topic to see come up at the top of the Jeopardy board?
Ken, I remember rooting for you every day on jeopardy when I was in elementary school, and I have never had the chance for a love Ama. What can I do to increase my chances of fulfilling my dreams? I know that a lot of it is just luck, but what can I do to increase my chances of luck happening to me?

Some questions Reddit users might have to Andy Weir are:,"What did you think of The Martian movie?
For the Martian, we know you had a LOT of great feedback to refine details that made the Martian scientifically more accurate. For your new book, how much did you have to lean on your community for this level of detail?
My introduction to you was The Egg and it changed my teenaged life! Just wanted to say thank you!   My q: if you HAD to choose to be an inanimate object, what would you choose, and why?   Thanks again! All the best.
Hi Andy! Congrats on the new book! I finished it a few days ago and absolutely loved it. I just found out last night that there’s already a movie in the planning with Ryan Gosling starring - what do you think of him playing Grace? Definitely nothing like who I pictured while reading PHM, but I was also pleasantly surprised with Matt Damon and The Martian.  (Unrelated follow-up - what have been your personal favorite or most anticipated to-read sci-fi novels?)  Thanks and congrats again!
Are there any artist renditions of Rocky?
If you had to name a single author who made you think: Yes I HAVE to write a novel, who would it be and why?
Of all of the ideas for writing you've ever had, is there one you can say, undoubtedly, is the single worst idea that you decided to backpedal on? If so, can you share it?
Is my Catholic upbringing showing, or was this intentional?  Hail Mary, a spaceship, whose sole living occupant is a man named Grace.  Hail Mary, full of Grace.  It took me until midway through Chapter 4 to realize what you did to me.
The Project Hail Mary Audiobook, narrated by Ray Porter, is so fantastic I will probably start a second time this week.    Did you get to choose or recommend Ray Porter? Because kudos on whomever made that call.   (For those who lack context, Ray Porter narrated the outstanding Bobiverse books by Dennis E. Taylor)
How cool was it to have your Martian character referred to in The Expanse? Think you might get a walk on before the show ends?
Hi Andy!  How much time do you put into the research for your books? How do you go about doing the research and formulating it into coherent words for people to read?  Also, as an aspiring scifi writer, favorite piece of advice?  (last thing) do you think Pluto is a planet?
Gonna spoiler, to make people want to go check out this wonderful work :)  >!The audiobook version replaced ""Rocky's"" speech with musical tones. I was surprised by this, in an exceptionally good way, and that you slowly explained it, and it made more sense through the text was wonderful. This is, obviously, only possible in the audio medium. Did you have input as to making this 'change', or was it 'planned all along' or somewhere in-between?!<
Did you change your writing style towards suitability for movies on purpose for Artemis?
Have you spent any time playing Kerbal Space Program? It's a fun PC game built around rocket science. You could call it research!
What brings you joy outside of writing?
Hi Andy. BIG fan from Brazil! Congrats on the new book! Do you plan to expand the universe (pun intended) of the space exploration frontiers in future books/works? I would love to see some kind of Asimov-like 500 years into the future kind of story to pick your brain on where to you think humanity is heading. Europa? Enceladus? Asteroid belt? Floating cities on Venus?
Loved the style and the slow reveal of the whole story. How much did the science guide the story, and was there any science that was annoyingly in the way of the story you wanted to tell?
Just started Hail Mary, I'm a researcher and a high school teacher so I really see myself in the character! The Martian and Artemis were a blast. Thank you so much! Out of the three main protagonists from your books, who  reflects you the most?  `Edit: Just finished ""Project Hail Mary"". I've been bawling my eyes for the past ten minutes. Thank you so much for this novel, I laughed tons throughout`
What made you decide to go with >!sightless creatures for the Eridians? Did it fall out of other design choices you made or did you start there and design the rest of the alien around it?!<
Been reading your stuff since about Chapter 5 of the Martian was posted on your site.  Can't wait to read Project Hail Mary.  How did the response to Artemis influence the direction of PHM?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Bruce Campbell are:,"What is one movie of yours that people may have missed that you would most recommend for them to watch?

Hey Bruce, BIG fan! Have been a huge Evil Dead fan from back when the first one came out, and the new show is more awesome than I even had hoped it would be. I have 2 questions.   1. Do you ever get tired of them spraying you in the face with bloody goo?  2. Do you think Brisco County Jr. Will ever make some sort of a return?
Bruce, you sexy beast of a silver fox! Has anything from any of the Evil Dead franchise turned your stomach and if so, what is it? And when are you going to let me interview you for my magazine?
How would Ash handle the world of 'The Walking Dead'? Boomstick vs. Lucielle?

Hi Bruce!  Almost a decade ago, I auditioned to be in My Name is Bruce. During my audition, you asked me to take part in an improv skit.  My task during the skit was to sell you a pie. Playing the part of a desperate baker, I attempted to sell you a pie. You walked into my shop, and curtly asked, ""What kind of pies do you have today?""  I replied back, (in my best Italian baker impression), ""Well, sir, we have apple pies, cherry pies, lemon menagerie pies...""  You quickly stopped me and pointed at an imaginary pie, ""What pie is that?""  I nervously replied again, ""Oh yes, sir, that is our famous blueberry pie""  Still pointing, you demanded, ""Alright, gimme that pie! I want to try it!""  And I obviously complied, and handed you that imaginary pie.  One scoop of pie in, you spat and exclaimed, ""What the hell?!? This pie tastes like shit!!!""  And at the time, I had no idea what to say, and rapidly muttered, ""Oh my fault, that was shit pie.""  ---  So Bruce, what pie is your favorite pie?

I work in the environmental field, trying to shift from field work to policy or advocacy. I've been so disheartened by how often it feels like one step forward, two steps back, even in places like Oregon where it seems like environmental policy is supported by the voters.  So my question is: what is the best thing that we, as laypeople and voters and everyday citizens, can do to combat this? Where should we target to make the greatest change? What solutions do you see, especially ones that are practical and pragmatic and achievable? Thanks for doing this.

As an Oregonian I absolutely hate the bottle deposit law, which recently increased to $0.10 per container.  I also recently learned that any unclaimed deposits are kept by the beverage producers (Coke, Pepsi, Nestle, etc.).  As someone with curbside recycling who still consciously decides to ""give away"" the deposit at the curb, why is there still a desire to create an unnecessary secondary waste stream and go through all the hassle the bottle deposit creates?   Is there any push to have the unclaimed deposits go towards a public service instead (roads, parks, etc.)?  
Optimally, how do you want people to help? Are there any initiatives we can support, donate to, or petitions to sign?

I know everyone on here is joking, but I really hope people don't believe the misconception that he is basically a cartoon character. He puts on a huge act for his American shows, you can tell when you watch an episode of Kitchen Nightmares US version and then UK version. On the UK version, he is properly strict, but also very understanding and level headed. The episode where he helps out a woman running a struggling soul food restaurant in England is fantastic. [Link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuYLjxmaNBE) He also has a documentary where he travels around South Asia (or maybe just India, can't remember) and eats around like a typical food doc. He's very humble, very intrigued by everything, you can tell he's super passionate and isn't just a mean cantankerous man in search of perfection like on his shows. If you can't tell already, Chef Ramsay is one of my biggest inspirations haha.

Why do you value narratives so highly?  Even if we cant create comprehensive models with only strict axioms, narratives just seem to be vague axioms that can be post hoc interpreted as correlating to whatever we discovered to be the case.  Also how to you tell the difference between supernatural causes and unknown natural causes?  Don't we have good inductive reasons to believe that any event we cant explain yet, will likely have an unknown natural cause that will be discovered in the future... and therefore unknown natural explanations should always be preferred to supernatural explanations?

Doctor Peterson, 20+ years ago, personality research showed correlation coefficients of about 80-90% in favour of heritability. Over the last 5 years, research is showing such coefficients to be 50%, and in some cases 40% in terms of heritability. It seems personality traits are not as enduring as what we originally thought. For example, Hudson & Fraley (2015) reported people could make meaningful changes to trait extroversion and conscientiousness in as little as 16 weeks. Moreover, 2017 research on prisoners found inmates increasing extraversion  and conscientiousness in order to survive/adapt to the prison environment in relatively short periods of time. It seems some traits within the big 5 may be more 'flexible' than others; conscientiousness seems to be one of those. What are your thoughts on this? There is plenty of evidence that shows trait conscientiousness slowly increasing over the lifespan; but what about in real-time?
Dr. Peterson you've claimed that the atrocities of Nazi Germany came out of a loss of belief in God. However only about 1.5% of Germans in 1939 claimed to lack a religious belief, and many of the anti-semitic beliefs propagated by the Nazis were inspired by those of Christian figures like Martin Luther. How can you explain the populist spread of Nazism in Germany as the result of atheism when the historical facts do not suggest such a conclusion?

Mr. Peterson, in the NY Times article, you referred to ""enforced monogamy."" It was later clarified that you meant ""normative monogamy,"" wherein monogamy is enforced by cultural norms.  So if that's what you meant, then how is that a solution to the problem if normative enforcement of monogamy already exists in our society to a degree?   When we speak of what is to be done about X issue, we are usually speaking in terms of policy. So the question is: What specific policy suggestions do you have that would ""enforce monogamy?"" 
Dr. Peterson, you have elaborated often on both the danger of ideological possession and the/your idea that meaning is real in a psychological \(an therefore necessarily physical) sense and described it as a feeling of deep engagement in sth. or being heavily gripped by sth., pouring your whole being into an activity or pursuit, followed by \(I guess\) a sense of maybe gratitude and pride towards oneself. To describe it you used phrases like ""That was great! That really was worth it!"". To me however this looks very similar to the state some PM/NM protestors or black block antifa people are in when doing their thing! **How can I as an individual \(or as a member of a social circle or even society at large\) distinguish between a deeply meaningful pursuit and possession of an idea/ideology?**
Dr. Peterson you've labelled the film *Frozen* as feminist propaganda because it suggested, you claim, that women don't need men. However the female protagonist of the movie actually accomplishes her goals in the film through the assistance of two male sidekicks.

Hello Dr. Peterson,  as a young man I grew up in a rough environment and was shaped by it.  I was in and out of jail by the time I was 14 and did many things that I still deeply regret to this day.    I turned my life around and now have a wonderful family and a career that exceeds my own expectations.  Yet I still feel guilty for my past and even for my own success, like I don't deserve it.  I feel like an outsider/fraud in professional settings.  Yet that same feeling is what drives me to be productive.  How can i reconcile the two?  Should I even attempt to do so? 
Hi Dr. Peterson, have you seriously considered Dyson's invitation to a black baptist church?
Dr. Peterson you once claimed in a lecture that the repetition of spiral twin-snake patterns in the art of ancient civilisations such as in Egypt, China and India somehow represent the double helix structure of DNA.

Some questions Reddit users might have to Danny Thompson are:,"how much fuel per mile would you be using at that speed (400mph) in that car?

What is the strangest ""can't explain this at all"" moment you've experienced while in the driver's seat?
Wow I did not expect to read about Challenger II being dusted off and setting records in 2016! So happy to see this.      A couple of questions....   First, checking out your website, it looks like you made the run on a Saturday and the return the next day. I always thought for speed records there was generally something like a 1 or 2 hour limit to turn around? Is there an official window?    Also, I remember reading many years ago (in the 80's or 90's) in one of the car mags that Bonneville was drying up, which was causing the salt to be more of a loose powder instead of hard packed, and that it might not be possible to race on someday. Do you know if this trend is continuing or did that turn out not to be the case?
I was at Booneville this year, ( I was the guy who rode 5000km just to see it) you inspired me to do it  Question- Are you going to attempt to up the record?  What's your best guess? & when?
Hello Danny  First thank you for during this AMA. I have a couple of questions. I hope that's alright.   When you crashed, when did you know something was wrong and what did it feel like?   Also what's your process for getting ready to do the fast run?   Lastly what's something funny or weird that people normally wouldn't think about the speed record?  Once again thanks!
How did you first start getting into racing? Was your mom against it? And also, could you see anything while going that fast? The tunnel vision must've been pretty insane...
Congratulations Danny. Some of the latest photos on your website show the car without a lot of the sponsorship livery, whereas previous pics show a lot of sponsorship. Is there a story there (that you can talk about)?
Danny, Could you tell a big difference in the handling of the car from the first 400+ pass to the runs this year with the updated exhaust and diffuser / splitter upgrades?
I've been 170 mph (speedo registered) on a superbike and it felt the same as 150.  Was there a point where you no longer noticed the additional speed?
Did the weight of your huge balls play a factor?
Can you please break down the total costs to build a vehicle of this caliber?

Did you do any wind tunnel testing for aerodynamics? 
Any pointers for anyone dumb enough to decided they want to get started in land speed racing and have to do it on a budget?  First class suggestion maybe?

First congrats. I was there Last weekend when you set the record and was looking at your car and noticed the rear engine has a different setup than the front engine. May I ask why?
Hi Danny! :)  What was your first car?"

John, Whenever asked about the journalistic merit of your show you get on the defensive, stating that you are a comedian and the fact that people think you're a journalist is a commentary on the state of journalism. My question is: Why can't you take a goddamn compliment?!
Why don't we have an automated weekly John Oliver AMA request thread already?
My Q: Apparently Dan Harmon is an absolute joy to work with. Any stories you'd like to share about your own experience with him?
I found the one other person who watches community. Will you come back to community?
I'd like to thank him for his part in informing the world about FIFA's corruption in a very entertaining manner.    Now John when will you be drinking your Bud Lime™ while scoffing every item on the McDonald's™ menu?
When you are overly joyous do people call you Jolliver?  and if so, do you refer to vacations as 'Jolliver's Travels'?  Please answer. This has been plaguing me for some time, now.
Oliver AMA? Yo quiero!  And I really hope he does at least some of the things he suggested, for the laughs
Of all the ridiculous news story... both depressing and just absurd, what is the one that just shocked you the most? 
Any chance the show will cover the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and reveal its absurdity to the masses? 
With everyone continuing to talk about the show and its impact, why isn't it called ""next week tonight?""
all the girls I know secretly have a crush on your adorable dorky british mannerisms and truthful, progressive views. When is your GQ photo shoot?
How is Bud Light Lime? Are you drinking one right now?
Does Bud Lime really taste like dumpster pee?    Mr. Oliver if everyone on TV was like you it would cease to be the fifth circle of hell.
Did you drink your bud light lime yet?
I just finished watching all the seasons of Community this week. It was a great show.  Are you sad that it's over?"

What's the worst decision you made career-wise?
Hi Mr. Moran, I love everything you do and have spent a considerable amount of time trying to convince my friends to watch your stuff so we can have more things to talk about. My question is - do you put your pants on like everybody else? 
Are their any plans for another stand up special? I love your work :)
I've just realised that I haven't seen you in any panel show. Is that a conscious decision not to appear in any?

On a scale of 1-10, how drunk are you right now?
Thanks for doing this AMA! Looking forward to seeing you again in Minneapolis.   A few things:   1) What inspires your drawing and other art?   2) At the end of a show here you asked 'what more do you want?' and I resisted the urge to shout out 'another tv series!' I know you've described the work for Black Books as enormous, but what are your thoughts on being in another show? I have no clue, but maybe a netflix original would be less demanding?   3) Finally...is there anything you'd like us to know about you?
Hello Dylan! Do you support any soccer/football team? 
Hi Dylan, You touched my hand once at a show in NZ. I haven't washed it since. Is Grumbling Mustard coming to NZ at all?   I think the last time you were here you went to Invercargill and seemed to enjoy it about as much as anyone does when they go to Invercargill. If you'd like to complete the tour of disappointing NZ towns, I can also recommend Palmerston North.
At one of your stand up shows, you said vegetarians who go to dinner parties should find their own dinner in the garden 😂 What are your thoughts on vegans?!?!
Mr. Moran, what's the 'Funk Soul Brother' of 2017 that you're the most perplexed by?

Some questions Reddit users might have to Jordan B Peterson are:,"What are your top pieces of academic advice for university students? 
What do you think of all of the memes about you?
Which questions are keeping you up at night? How can we assist you in finding answers to them?
Professor, you have talked in your lectures  about wasting time and not operating even close to our potential effectiveness. How can on defeat lethargy and procrastination? (I know you've mentioned things like getting up early and eating breakfast). Do you follow a detailed day plan? Thanks!!
What advice would you give to someone like myself who is suffering from severe anxiety and depression to the point where they can't even leave their bed all day? You are a huge inspiration to me and I would really appreciate your insight.
What should low conscientiousness people do?
Hi Dr. Peterson, we hope that you will join us some time on /r/jordanpeterson or /r/Maps_of_Meaning.   - What do you make of your popularity among atheists?  - Have you read much of Rene Girard? If not, I think you will be struck by the many complimentary parallels with your views.   - What does the 'B' stand for?  - Top 5 favourite music acts/albums? and why is #1 Tom Waits?  - Does your world view require belief in a conscious agent's ability to suspend the natural order?   - Do you have any thoughts about M-103 passing?  edit: a typo 
Dr. Peterson,   I have often felt that the phrase ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" was imprecise, but could never put my finger on exactly how. Do you think it is an accurate statement of how we should treat each other and our actions, and if not, how then should we act?
Good evening Dr. Peterson.  1.  In a previous AMA (on youtube) you've called Frozen - and other later era Disney movies - ""propaganda"" - that is, only half the truth.  This probably has to do with the presentation of masculine/feminine achetypes.  Can you expand?  2.  How does one choose, and adhere to, transcendent values without falling into ideological possession?   It seems to me both things involve service to a higher value.  Thank you!
Dr. Peterson,  I am wondering how you typically address motivational issues that stem from chronic depression. Is there a real answer on how to create meaning, enthusiasm, and inspiration in your life in spite of the apathy and numbness that comes from depression, or is this a simple matter of biting the bullet and getting things done through diligence and willpower and hoping everything else will fall into place?  And a follow up: How do you feel about using psychedelic drugs (psilocybin mushrooms in particular) for introspective purposes in order to get a leg up on depression?
What concepts of Nietzsche's writings are the most important or useful to your thinking?
How do you feel about how online communities bearing your name have understood and disseminated your ideas? What instances of your name or arguments made have you come across that you find disagreeable?  Kudos and thanks for inspiring so many buckos to sort themselves out!

As a clinical psychologist and an all-around wise man, what advice do you have on social anxiety?
Dr. Peterson, like many I find your analysis on creation myths fascinating. Do you have any similar thoughts regarding end-time myths like Revelations? Thank you
Dr. Peterson, are there ever moments where one should lie?  Or is it best to sometimes say, ""I'd rather not discuss that"" than to lie?
How can I learn to raise my children properly or wisely?  What books or lectures are useful?
Hello, Dr. Peterson,  How would you define your God? Do you believe in the supernatural? Do you pray?  Thank you

Doctor, you know your wife for a long time. At some point you decided to always speak the truth.  The question is: did you tell your wife about the decision at once, or after some time?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to David Simon are:,"What can a common person do to stop the death of journalism?
Do you think The Wire could work better in today's tv landscape? 
Hi Mr. Simon!     Are there any aspects/elements of New Orleans you wanted to capture in Treme but were unable to, perhaps due to time constraints, or difficulty of transferring a sometimes intangible and elusive reality to the screen? 
The section from The Corner on being an urban public school teacher described my experiences to a tee.  What systemic changes do you think could cause a shift to make schools more functional?
Hi David, firstly Homicide is the best book I've ever read, a genuinely amazing piece of work, thank you.   Secondly, what was the most interesting thing you learned during your time with the homicide police?   Cheers
I loved the scene in The Wire where Rawls is shown in the gay bar. The fact it was never brought up again made it a sort of inside scoop just for the viewer.   Was there ever a temptation to explore this in a storyline?
Hi David,  What do you think changed a lot in Baltimore since you made The wire in a bad and better way ?
First of all, thank you for making Treme.  It was an incredible gateway not only info all things New Orleans, but jazz, food, culture and American history.  Any plans in the future for a project that shines a spotlight on another part of American culture that goes relatively unnoticed?  
Hi David.  The language on The Wire used is so real and doesn't feel forced or cringe as so many programs that try to represent 'the streets' do. How did you go about that?
Hi Mr. Simon,  As a criminal prosecutor (who's still somewhat salty about not getting that court-themed sixth season of The Wire), I constantly marvel at how little seems to have changed since that show's conclusion seven years ago. Indeed, the cyclical nature of our criminal justice system, and the idea that attempts at reform are often futile, seems to be one of the underlying themes of the show.   What signs of hope, if any, have you observed since 2008? Do you believe that policing and criminal justice reform are moving in the right direction?
If you had to create a couple more seasons for The Wire, what themes/angles would you have included?
High school English teacher here and I use an excerpt from *Homicide* every year as a run-up to my *Lord of the Flies* unit- the part where the police raid the rowhouse and discover the dozens of people living in utter squalor. I've ended up purchasing and then giving away at least 10 copies of the book.  If there were one book you'd have each high schooler in modern America read, what would it be?
Hi David,  Your realistic approach to the negative sides of the War on Drugs is beautifully explored in The Wire. How would you go about changing American Drug policy?
How tough was it to get permission for Springsteen's music in Show Me A Hero? 
Am I reading too much into the symbolism of the train track scenes in The Wire? Or am I missing the point perhaps? I've always seen them as representing the inevitable force of the war on drugs, or corruption in general. Try to stand in its way, and you could lose everything.
Hi David, I heard you mention a possible project portraying the Spanish Civil War (I think it was on Marc Maron's WTF Podcast) do you have any updates on this? And what was your inspiration for this? I've read Orwell's 'Homage to Catalonia' and would love to see a project like this, especially with you at the helm.
Hi David,  Where do you see print journalism heading in the next decade? Any examples of recent work that you find interesting?  Thanks.
What was your biggest regret content wise about The Wire? Is there any material or message you wish you had included and/or approached differently?
Hi David! We worked together on SMAH. Bill Zorzi was my favorite person on set. Can you share a good Zorzi story?   Also, very proud to have worked on that job!
What's your take on the Black Lives Matter vs. Blue Lives Matter situation?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Bruce Campbell are:,"What would be the first thing you did if you actually had a chainsaw for a hand?
Bruce, first I want to thank you for keeping the B movie alive. Your work in movies like My Name is Bruce and Bubba Ho Tep is amazing, not to mention The Evil Dead series (the second one is one of my favourite movies of all time). Ash vs the Evil Dead has already GREATLY exceeded my expectations. Everything you do is gold.   My question to you is... I didn't think that far ahead, shit. Uhhh... Did you grow up watching those classic B movies such as ~~The Taming of the Shrew~~ The Killer Shrews? If so, which was your favourite?
Hey Bruce! I've grown up watching you on film and television, I have always wondered which was more fun to make? Movies or television?
does playing Ash now feel any different from when you first started playing him?
What ever happened to the damned Oldsmobile?
How much fun was it playing Reagan in Fargo?
Back in 1997(ish) I wrote you a letter telling you how I'd started a Bruce Campbell Fan Club in my hometown of Eugene, Oregon. I mentioned that if you ever came through town to give me a call and I'd take you out for pie.  A few months later, I came home and my mom told me, in her words, ""Some adult sounding guy called for you. All he said was to tell you your friend Bruce says hi.""  Was that actually you?   If so, I hope you realize the depths of sorrow in my soul all these years knowing I just missed out on pie with Bruce Campbell.
Any chance of a Bubba Hotep 2? That movie was awesome!
I enjoyed the humor in your books. Have plans for another, sir?
Bruce - loved you in the Evil Dead, Burn Notice, and so many other productions!  My question is out of all the roles you've been in, which one was closest to exhibiting your real personality?
Hey Bruce!  Was it tiring carrying the chainsaw around for all those scenes, or did they make a special prop one that was far lighter?  I've got a bet going on this, and you could help me win five bucks.
Hey Bruce! If you could have been in any other movie(or T.V. show) that you weren't already in, which would it be and what character would you have played?
Hey Bruce! How many times did you actually injure yourself while filming the Evil Dead Movies?  
Do you ever wear the Tommy Bahama shirt my friends and I gave you on Halloween, 2008, at the My Name is Bruce screening in New York? (You exchanged it with us for the one you were wearing.)
Loved your work as the narrator in the old spiderman games I had on gamecube.  In The Fall of Sam Axe, did you come up with the line: ""Don't listen to bad girl. One time, she gives kiss to a monkey. On his mouth. It's true. I saw it.""  That whole episode was funny/great, and I was wondering how much creative freedom they gave to Sam/Chuck and if any lines were created on the spot?
How often do you stare at your reflection and tell yourself ""hail to the king, baby""?
Bruce, what's your most embarrassing audition story?
Do you ever get lonely enough to talk to the Necronomicon? 
Are you still into mojitos after all Burn Notice?
How do you feel about the impact and legacy that Ash and Evil Dead left on the horror genre?    How did you feel about Cabin in the Woods take on the genre?    What do you think needs to happen to improve the quality of horror movies we have received in the past few years? Besides a few stand outs, horror (especially American horror) seem to stick to the same ideas.     Thanks Bruce, huge fan!"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Lisa Fletcher are:,"As a pet owner, what can we do to avoid stuff like this? Just hope for the best, and support our local journalists?
I just wanted to say THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BREAKING THIS STORY!!!  My dog almost died to this because her treats were affected and we had no idea until we had seen it in the news. We had a few grand in vet bills and no one could figure out what was wrong, but we threw the treats away and she started recovering quickly after that.  How did you stumble upon this story, and what kind of resources did you have to tap into to research it?
I read about this years ago in a book called ""Food Pets Die For"" which was originally published in 1997. Did that book factor into your investigation at all?
Were there any reports of dog deaths or illnesses, especially older dogs??
Hi Lisa!  Thanks for doing an AMA, especially on a topic so many people hold near and dear--our pets.  I'm curious, how did you come across this story? It's not exactly something I feel like one would notice normally. Second question: What is something you thought you knew, but later found out you were wrong about? (And no fair saying, ""I thought my dog's food *didn't* contain pentobarbital but then found out that it did.)  Thanks again!
Can you look into corruption at the Bakersfield police department here In California going up to the highest ranks?
How did you become an investigative reporter and what is it like? It’s always a career that’s been really interesting to me
Did dogs have any reported effects from eating these brands of food?
How did you react when you found out about it?
OK. This drug is used for non lethal sedation at lower dosages and euthanasia at higher dosages. The level of contamination was lower than the sedation dosage when orally ingested. So what consideration went into the characterization of this drug as a euthanasia drug rather than simply a sedative? Were you intentionally choosing a sensational headline over a more balanced one?  
Is there an ethical issue re-using animals for food? Or does the issue stem form having the euthanizing drug found in the newly formulated food?  I eat spam (never waste food) and I'm 100% certain its the left overs of some random animals.
Do other countries have the same issues with pet food ingredients as USA does?  Like I’m wondering if there is a “best country” to raise your pet in. If maybe there is something other countries do right that USA does wrong that could be fixed somehow.
Over a decade ago, my dog was diagnosed with kidney disease and died shortly after. I was told by my vet that the cause was most certainly his food. (This was confirmed through blood tests and the Vets experience, he had dealt with many of these same cases) I was also told that there was nothing I could do to get justice for the pain and suffering caused to my dog and my family. Is this true? Can we not sue the everloving shit out of these companies for hurting or otherwise endangering our beloved pets?
How do you work for a company owned my Sinclair broadcasting and still sleep at night? 
Was the drug found in significant quantities, or trace amounts?  From other comments, I've gathered that no animals were actually affected, so is this story just a bunch of scaremongering?  edit: just read one of the articles linked, and it was found in 'non-lethal amounts' but actual numbers aren't listed, so I'm gonna assume it was trace amounts and therefore scaremongering.
Where did you get that awesome flower dress in your proof picture? I’d like to get one for my daughter!
Off topic questions:         Have you ever genuinely feared for your life while working on a story?       Have you ever had a story squashed by management?       Have you ever had to deal with news groupies? Or worse, stalkers?
How do you feel about the current state of journalism? As someone that was interested in it as young, I am ashamed to see what kind of thing it turned into.
Where is the pet food in question produced?
How did these companies not learn from Nutro in the '90s? So many sick dogs, including my boy."

What was your favorite moment when filming Arrested Development? 
Were the producers of Veep reluctant to bring you on knowing that they would need to crop out your hook hand every episode?  Does this show how great of an actor you are to overcome that tragedy and continue your career as an actor? 
Hi Tony! I'm a huge fan of AD and Veep. The cast on both seem to get along so well, and everyone seems to have such a fantastic sense of humor. Have there been any really memorable scenes for you that were hard to shoot because some cast members couldn't stop laughing? Thanks in advance for your time and your response.

I have a lot of questions, Number 1: How dare you?
What is point of ama with someone who outright lies and/or gives vague/deceptive answers?
Hi guys, can someone give me the lowdown (preferably without game spoilers) on what's gone so wrong? I went on holiday for three weeks and only got back a few days ago. Basically, I saw all this hype for the release (I even tried to preorder but I couldn't get my account to work). Now that I'm back I'm hearing all this bad press and seeing the game getting torn apart!? Surely things can't be that bad when the concept was so good and the development was so lengthy?
>Why have you remained Quiet?  He's not Quiet, he's Sean. I don't get this question.
I really don't like how people want to have an AMA pretty much just so they can shit on someone. Thats in poor taste. These questions might as well be ""do you suck? Why do you suck? How does it feel to suck?"" He seems like a nice guy and I'm sure he's not just basking in the glory of misleading people.  I was a little excited and a little disappointed by NMS, but I got over it, because I once again got my hope up too much. A lot of what people had built up was just in their heads, like it was going to be an orgasm in game form. It *never* is, and yet the gaming community *always* insists on overhyping it. Be more wary. Just saying, it's not just the developers fault, it's the stupid consumers fault as well. I'm tired of seeing this response every year about a game. Maybe people will start to learn one day.
so you're more looking for an Answer Me Anything than an Ask Me Anything on this one?
I feel like people just want to crucify Sean Murray, and honestly, what's the real point?
Did you really think we wouldn't notice?
Why would he come here to be berated by asshats on the internet? I'm sure there will be civil people, but they'll be drowned out. 
Shit post and probably not the right place for it but I need to vent cause I'm tired of seeing people still upset about what happened. They showed no game play regarding any of the features Murry talked about. If someone was trying to get you excited for content that they had planned don't you think they'd fucking show it?      Of course Sean Murry lied about many of the games features he needed to make his investment back. You guys know the answer to all these questions.
Pretty sure he did an AMA the day before NMS's release?
Were there differences in the pre-launch version and the live one that got patched? I wonder if there was content there that was removed because of it, like the galactic center chest?
> What is your response to the online outrage?      If he had a legitimate response he would have given it to us by now. 
1. Who do you think you are?  ""I'm... Sean.""  2. What... Gives you the right...?
No publicity company worth anything would let him near an AMA.  There is zero chance it would help the company or his reputation.  Can you say ""unmitigated disaster""?
Why did you lie, lie and lie in your interviews Sean? Why did you do this to us Sean? How can you sleep at nights knowing that you fucked a lot of people over for your own good? 
Curious as to why you along with the rest of the community currently holding digital pitchforks feel you're owed anything at all?

You seem to think all jokes involving minorities are offensive, but jokes about whites and males are hilarious. What is your reasoning for this?  I think he'd answer this really well.

John, how awesome is OP's name?  Praise be unto you.
Hi John! I am a big fan of your comedic deliverance and your political stance on a few major issues. I have a couple of questions for you.  1. Do you like being compared to Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert? If so, how do you deviate from that kind of formula to make yourself different? 2. If you interviewed Bill Maher, what would you talk about?  Thanks John! :)

mr Oliver, who would you have a cook off against?
Hi John!  1. Will you ever tire of the geography jokes? 2. Why do you think it's all right to mock straight, white males, literally the most persecuted class of peoples in human history? 3. Are there any downsides to working with HBO rather than a general cable network? 4. Will you ever apologize for featuring a 30-second clip of professional victim Anita Sarkeesian during your segment on female harrassment, given that it's  known fact that all the ""threats"" against her are SJW false flags? 5. Can we ever expect a segment on the TPP? 6. Why do you believe LGBT citizens should have more rights than an upstanding, God-fearing normal business owner? 7. Is Poe's Law in full enough effect that the sincerity of this post will be accepted at face value?
""Did anyone send you semen when you asked for their seed?"" Is what I would ask
With all the piles of money you're raking in from HBO, are you going to fix your jacked up teeth, or is it just a British thing?
Why won't he do a AMA?
Consider the following 2 scenarios: Person higher status in a society says an offensive thing about a person of lower status, and vice versa: lower offends higher. Reflecting on the offended person's experience in each situation, are the statements equally painful? Does the status of a person saying a thing affect the intensity, projection, or core meaning of the thing said?
How about we just accept that it's okay to make fun of everyone for anything because the purpose of comedy is to make people laugh, not hurt people?"

Thank you so much for being apart of the show that has brought me so much happiness. 
Neil, I think that you are a great person and a great example for pretty much anyone.  What advice would you give to somebody who struggles socially and gets very anxious when the possibility of rejection is present?

Neil, Last year I read your autobiography, and it gave me the courage and final push I needed to publicly come out at the age of 28.  A few months later, I was quite intentionally not invited to my old neighbor/best-friend-since-childhood's wedding, while the rest of my family including my brother attended.  I assume my sexuality has everything to do with it as no one ever got an explanation, and he hasn't spoken to me since.  We were close.  Like Ted and Marshall close.  I've been shocked and devastated.  Did you experience any personal heartbreak/loss like this when you came out?  How did you handle it?  Thanks for being such an inspiration!  ❤️

An ex-girlfriend of mine purchased one of these for me as a semi-gag gift last Valentines.  To my surprise, it actually worked quite effectively!  So thanks, for making every poop remind me of her...  My question is, how many of these do you think were purchased out of pure novelty?  And did that factor influence your marketing?

So I took the band's poster off the wall and asked everyone to sign it. You wrote: ""I'm the bassist!""  So my question is, what was it like playing bass for Hot Hot Heat?

Thanks for a great article!   For those who want to be conscientious consumers of delivery services in NYC - which platform is considered best by those making deliveries? Any pointers besides making tips in cash?
Do you feel delivery drivers should be a flat rate per hour , or the way it is, ? flat rate like 5 an hr plus tips ?
Hi Andy, thanks for this piece, I’m fairly involved in cycling in nyc and used to do Postmates myself when one could make a good living from bonus’s.  Couple of questions.  Do you regularly cycle in New York City? With the spate of recent cyclist deaths city wide what do you feel can be done to best protect cyclists.   Do you feel that there is a possible alternative to large trucks flying around the city, including ideas like railroad or truck hubs and last mile fulfillment via small vans or bicycles?   What do you think is the most likely scenario for the future of food delivery? I.e. drones, robots, pneumatic tubes, cheap immigrant labor?
Did you get to collect 2 glorious paychecks while doing the investigation?    &#x200B;  Always was curious if you get to keep the money from the company you were investigating.
What is the average earning per day?
 Just yesterday, my friend ordered $115 worth of food and when the doorsash deliverer met him in a car at the destination, the doorsash deliverer would not give the food without a tip. The conversation ended in the doorsash deliverer driving off with the food.   So my questions are: Are customers suppose to 100% pay a tip? And are there any consequences for a doorsash deliverer to deliberately run/drive off with the food if there is no tip?
Do you think it's a good time for muckraker style journalism to come back?
In your opinion, what is more dangerous when biking in NYC: cars or pedestrians?
Are you getting hate mail or threats from drivers who liked the old system?
What was the rudest thing a customer has ever done to you?
I've always thought $25 fast food meals is simply not worth it. These services have brought out the worst in Americans. My question to you is, is there a particular characteristic that you found in most of these customers? Of course, without offending any particular group.
What led you to this story?  Do you feel this article will help the efforts to regulate And boost pay for the delivery people?  Extremely interesting investigative report; and  from a NYT subscriber I offer a thank you.
What stories are you working on now?
When you started this story, did you expect DoorDash would continue to be taking drivers' tips just months after InstaCart was publicly humiliated for doing the same thing?
so what happens when they change the pay model and it ends up like Postmates and we only make $3 per delivery and nobody tips then what do we do?
ive noticed that many of these apps calculate tips based on the entire cost of the delivery (food plus their own fees, plus tax, plus the delivery fee) Instead of just on the food or product you ordered. These fees, at least on postmates, can add up to 30 or 40% on top of what you are ordering. So this way of calculating the tip can be really misleading. Does this fall into any legal category or is it just up to them how to make this calculation and up to consumers to realize what they are doing?
Can you do the same thing with all the tipped restaurants that do the same thing and take $5.12 an hour of out tips for themselves to pay for part of that $7.25 minimum wage?
who is the biggest a\*\*hole you had to deal with?
Can you offer any insight as what sort of vetting of potential deliverers occurs? Any background checks? Order take out all the time but typically pick up after being threatened/propositioned by a food delivery person at my door a number of years back. Felt exceedingly vulnerable as a woman home alone. Witness any poor delivery behaviors? Adulterated food etc.?   Loved the local neighborhood place that charged a 20% delivery fee on all orders and gave it directly to the delivery people at the end of the night. So much safer and more comfortable for the customer."

Some questions Reddit users might have to DJ Shadow are:,"Please settle a bet for me. I pitched you for composing the soundtrack for a new tv series for a major television network in the U.S. that will eventually be on demand as well.

 Hi!   I saw you at Brixton Academy many years ago and it blew my mind! Can't wait for the new album.  Silly question, maybe. How and why did you come up with the name Shadow?  Just wanted to say hello, and thanks for doing what you do :)
Shadow,   Huge fan. Thanks for doing this.  What are you using to produce music these days? Are you using a DAW or hardware or combination of the two? Does the 3000 still see any use? Also, what happened with purchasing Music Exchange is KC? Rumor was you were trying to buy it at one point. 
Huge fan of your work, my question is how do you want to be remembered as an artist and as a person?
Hola shadow.  Do you usually look for roots in foreign music? I just returned from Cusco Perú and felt into the spoken rhithims with percussion  and a fusion of rock. So, are you interesed in coming to another cultures and mix their sounds ?  Get a touch with Traffic Sound, my favorite  band in Perú. Im sure it will inspire you to come  Please. Let me know
It's an honor to be able to ask you a question!  When I saw you do the Shadowsphere tour, I was delighted with the amount of drum & bass that you incorporated into the set.  Are you a big d&b fan?  What are some producers from that genre that you listen to?
If you could make a full album with any rapper who would it be?
Been a huge fan of yours for a while now, even saw you perform a few times (one time in that giant spinning orb thing, it was super rad). You're a legend, my man.  I make music too from time to time, but my biggest problem is not being able to ""finish"" projects, I just have stuff lying around for years that slowly gets plucked at 'till I either lose interest or call it done. Do you experience anything similar? And do you have any tips on getting past that ""writer's block""?

Hey Shadow! Thanks for taking the time to answer questions!  Endtroducing and The Private Press are some of my favorite albums of all time!

Hey AJ thanks for doing this AMA. I've always been interested to know what the biggest change in an NFL players life is after they sign a big contract and come into a lot of money. What was the biggest change in your life when you signed your first contract?   Also, you make freak plays all the time. do you know they are freak catches or plays when you make them or is it just another day in the office?
on [this catch](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/AJTD.gif) it looks like you put your hands upward to trick Arenas into putting his hands up, before stretching out left and grabbing the ball where it was actually going. Were you intentionally faking out the Defender, or did you notice the ball was going somewhere else and adjust?  Either way, it's one of the greatest plays I've ever seen. Thanks!

What event have you reported that surprised you as it saw the biggest social change despite it possibly being not the biggest story at the time?
Are you on Big Fat Quiz of the Year again this year?
Who is the most impressive politician you've talked with before?
Out of all the people you have interviewed, who has been the most frustratingly evasive?
When you stop broadcasting, (which I hope won't be for a while yet!), would you ever consider going into politics? I ask that as you have been so close to it for so long. 
You, David Dimbleby and Trevor McDonald are locked in a shipping container and only one of you is getting out alive. Which one of you will it be?

What is the CRAZIEST story you think you've ever covered?
Hi Jon, thanks for doing this AMA!  What do you think is currently the biggest political problem facing Britain at the moment? And how do you think it might develop? 
Where do you get your ties?
Happiest moment in your career?
You have been criticised by many for bringing your political opinions into your reporting too much (mainly people confusing your Twitter opinions with your actual job in reporting). I for one think that you do remain balanced.  Do you find it difficult to keep your own personal opinions out of your reporting? and Has your political stance changed over the years as a result of the things you have seen and experienced?
It's a matter of record that the UK Secret Intelligence Service tried and failed to recruit you in the mid 70s. Have you ever regretted your decision to turn them down given how the nature of threats to the UK have changed, and did they ever try again? 
You present Drugs Live with cannabis and MDMA. Did anything in the show change your opinion about the drugs or even drug use as a whole?
Would it be fair to say there has been a general decline in the quality and morality and of the british media over the last forty years?  If you agree or disagree, why?
Jon, just wanted to say that Channel 4 news is an absolutely fantastic program. Truly brilliant. I consider yourself and Krishnan to be the Batman and Robin of world news.   My question for you is: how do you structure your day so that when you're on air at 7 you're fully prepared and briefed? Do you have a team who you go over the events of the day with or do you formulate most of your lines of questioning yourself?   Also how many ties do you roughly own?   ALSO is it really true that you once contemplated taking out Idi Amin? Didn't you also once conduct some sort of commando style operation in a wetsuit to rescue somebody on a ship in the Shatt al-Arab waterway? 
Jon !   I am the Irish guy who said hello to you behind Notre Dame after the attacks in Paris a couple of weeks back. Thank you so much for stopping to take time to speak to me and my friend, I really appreciate it!   If I could ask you anything, I would ask how do you keep patience and optimism for the people of Palestine? Your reports about that part of the world are some of the most insightful and compassionate.   Thanks again ! 
What do you think of Donald Trump? How will you react if he eventually wins the US presidential election? "
Some questions Reddit users might have to Charles Williams are:,"If you don't mind me asking, how long have you had your disability? It was very subtle in the video. If it was intentionally not mentioned, I applaud you and the video-makers! It is an issue that is not of any importance for the matter at hand. Regardless, I am still curious.   Did you build this personal garage so that you could work on cars on your own time with your disability? How has it effected your work?
How did they get all that building code ""evidence"" without trespassing on your property?
Settle a bet, is that garage attached to your house at all or totally freestanding?
What cars do you drive/have you driven? Just curious as a gearhead to know what someone so dedicated to fixing cars drives themselves.
Have you had a good relationship with these neighbours before the complaints or have they ever come to you to express their concerns before going to bylaws and such?
Mr. Williams, it appears that a court decision in your favor came out in June regarding the suit by your neighbors.  Are they appealing or are they pursuing further claims against you?  
I live in the tri state area, can I come visit your garage? I don't know how to change my oil and I'd love to learn lol. 
What is their underlying motivation? Why do you think these women really care so much about shutting you down?
Ignoring how ape shit your neighbors would go if you did this of course--have you ever considered offering free classes or seminars for kids in the area who want to learn about auto repair/maintenance?
If they can't pursue you legally, do you think they'll stop after the whole things gets sorted out by the Judge?
Will you be pursuing for them to cover the legal fees once you win? I can imagine this has put a lot of financial strain on your family.
Do either of your neighbors who are filing these complaints have any background in city or county building codes and or permits? 
It seems very odd to me that the women all of a sudden decide to be pissed off and then you get served papers.  Was there a defining incident or some kind of altercation that started them on this path?
Have you ever asked for monetary compensation for any repairs done for your neighbors/friends?
How do you feel this situation is perceived in your local community? Clearly, the internet (and probably for good reason) is almost completely on your side.
What kinds of cars do you like working on the best? What's your current ""baby"" project?
To your knowledge, what do these 2 women do in their spare time? Do they have jobs or hobbies?   Why do you think your situation offends them so much?
So at any point did they tell you upfront their concerns, like.. you know any reasonable adult would?  Or the sheriffs office just showed up with that civil suit one day completely out the blue?
If the judge rules in your favor, do you plan to seek restitution for legal fees incurred?  On a different note, Craftsman, or Snapon?
Was that a C-10 in the video? Was the top chopped? Looks cool! Can you share some details on that? "
Some questions Reddit users might have to Frank Oz are:,"What is the most emotional character you've ever performed?
I'd really like to know something about the genesis of _What About Bob?_. It's one of my own all-time favorite comedies, though not ""universally loved"".

Hi Frank, i'm from Vancouver, BC. Just wondering what it was like to come back to the Star Wars franchise after all this time and perform with Mark, and also who came up with the page turner line? That was perfect!
Hi Frank!  Thanks so much for doing this AMA.  I've heard some of the backstories about your characters that help you figure out who they are offscreen.  (I've heard the stories about Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal, and Marvin Suggs.)  Do you have similar backstories for your Sesame Street characters like Grover, Cookie Monster, or Bert?  Or some of your lesser-known characters like George the Janitor or Lefty the Salesman?
Hi. What was it like working with Alan Tudyk on Death at a Funeral? I love his performance in that film. 
I'm from Marin County, CA.  Do performers that work with Muppets get shoulder injuries? It looks painful to have your arm up in the air for long periods of time.
Hi mr. Oz, greetings from the Netherlands!  I am a great fan of the movie Dark Crystal.  Do you maybe have an amusing or interesting anecdote to share from working on it? 
Hi Frank! From Virginia.  If you had to pull off a heist using a team of only Muppet performers who would you choose and why? 
Hi Frank! Scott from New England here.  An [old interview with Ken Plume on IGN](http://web.archive.org/web/20040406124600/http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/317/317757p1.html) claims that your full name was/is Richard Frank Oznowicz. The shortening of your name to Oz is pretty well-documented, but I've never seen the ""Richard"" part corroborated elsewhere. As an administrator for Muppet Wiki, I'd like to be able to make sure we're being factual. Is it true; is Richard your birth/legal first name?  Thanks so much for everything!
Hello Frank! Dwayne from Kingsport Tennessee here. Lifelong fan and I just want to Thank you for helping make the Muppets such a huge part of my life.  I have heard you talk about the direction the Muppets have gone in recent projects. My question is what do you think Disney and the Muppets need to do now going forward? They have had a movie and a TV show be unsuccessful and I wonder is it because they are truly a thing of the past or do they just need to move in a different direction? 
Hi Reddit!  I'd love to know where everyone is, so when you ask a question, could you also let me know where you live?
Hi, Laura from Chicago. Frank, you are my hero and Miss Piggy is my spirit animal. From the bottom of my heart - thank you for my childhood! Who was your greatest influence growing up?
Was Miss Piggy’s voice hard on your vocal cords? Specifically, the singing? I'm from Denmark.
How do you feel about the legacy you've helped create? Is it ever surreal to see how much people love the Muppets, Dark Crystal, etc.?

Hi Jordan!  Thanks for doing this AMA. In Bruges is one of my all time favourite movies! My questions are as follows:  - The film has become, in my opinion, a bit of a cult classic. Were you and the rest of the cast aware of the impact the film would have? Did the reaction match your expectations?  - I thought your performance in the film was very funny, but your place in the plot seemed to hinge entirely around your stature. What are your thoughts on the representation of small people in this film?  - Peter Dinklage's role in a recent x-men film had very little, if anything, to do with his stature. Do you think that there is more scope for these sorts of roles in film, or are the roles always going to focus in some way on the stature of the actors?  - Who is your favourite actor?  Thanks again!
What's your favorite beer? And does being of your stature influence your alcohol tolerance?
Hi! Thank you for doing this AMA! My question- I know someone of shorter height who is interested in acting but she is afraid her height will not help her. Any advice? By the way you are so handsome!

What do you think about the the fact, that little people always play roles where their size matters? 
How's the ketamine treating you?
What was working on Howard the Duck like?
I loved AUF AUGENHÖHE, and was wondering: - Did your young co-star have trouble adapting to your height as much as his character? - How did you actually film this when you were speaking in English, which he probably doesn't understand? - I found the relationship between your character and his sport buddies particularly interesting, because it was full of possible misunderstandings, hurt feelings and experiences. Did your personal experiences influence the script, or did you feel it adequately represented some of your experiences as a person of short stature?
Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle?

Some questions Reddit users might have to Chris Hunt are:,"Did you make the Beak Things?  DID YOU MAKE THE FUCKING BEAK THINGS YOU ASSHOLE!?
What made you choose the ogre engine when you started making the game?
Were you expecting the game to spawn such a huge modding community?      Also can we expect more hairstyles/faces for character creation in Kenshi 2? Or possibly more races?
A moderator here for r/Kenshi, asking questions for those among the community who couldn't make it. :)  u/alfredo0634 asked:  Is kenshi 2 supposed to be way before the 1st? What can we expect to see? As in world state, cars, giant robots, bigger cities, Etc  u/Aglorius3 asked:  I saw that Kenshi may get moved to the newer engine. Is that true and is there an ETA? Will the new game have landscape and object LOD?  u/nectos asked:  Will you allow modding to go further than FCS and let us do insane mods like Skyrim, Fallout 4?
Kenshi is an awesome game, but after a while there's a breaking point where base defence gets a bit monotonous, you only get patrolls of infantrymen trying to bring down a gate covered by a lot of turrets. Are there plans for introducing different types of defenses like traps or siege weapons to spice up that aspect?
Have you seen Sseth's video about kenshi? Cause I bought the game thanks to him and I'd really like to know what you thought about it
1. Our assumption of this game currently is that it will be like the last days before the collapse of the (Roman) empire, as opposed to a century or millenia later in its fallout. **How will the advanced technology of the past affect weapons and combat in the new Kenshi?** More ranged combat focus? Power armour? Whatever [This](https://www.albion-swords.com/images/april1/2014/ultimate%20tactical%20katana%20copy.jpg) thing is? 2. The main factions in Kenshi 1 are famed for their lack of holding the moral high ground. You intended for players to be the Robin Hoods, but a highly requested feature was for players to be more like Fallout New Vegas' Caesar's Legion and do the same things. **Will players have more control over whether to be lawful evil?** 3. **Player cities?** Please?  (No more questions from me after this)
Was it surprising to you how popular the game got?
As we know from some others  this question does get asked a few times  Is Kenshi a moon, or a  planet?  and who revolves around who
Do you have plans to expand the FCS's options beyond the scope of what you need for implementation in either Kenshi 2 or even 1? You've made some additions and think you asked what more could be added on steam but it still lacks little things that modders have wanted for a long time - TAKING items away during dialogue, arbitrary world states to trigger through dialogue alone, spawning NPCs on the spot, and so on. It would help a lot to even expand existing functions to other items - like full skill bonuses for all types of equipment, some conditional checks, even those animation overrides could be added to equipment or triggered through dialogue or attached to an AI package.  And thank you for the amazing game.
That's some nice skin you've got there. Are you using it, orrrrr....?
First, thank you so much for bringing Kenshi into this world.  To both Chris and Nat: Is there an area or bit of lore that you are exceptionally proud of?
I'd just like to applaud both Chris and Nat (and the other writers in the background) for their work on the style and substance of the world.  The world you've made in Kenshi is enticing and vibrant. You give enough information to base off of and allow the player to fill in the blanks with their own preferred head canon.  I cannot wait to find out Kenshi 2 and any future projects you do, within or outside of the Kenshi world.  **QUESTION**  Can I ask if you have considered branching off the current world Kenshi is set on perhaps after Kenshi 2 or will you stick with the same world? Was Kenshi 2 being set 1000 years in the past your first choice or did you consider other possibilities too?
Kenshi was inspired by stories of traveling ronin, according to Wikipedia. Can you give us a few specific examples of books and stories that acted as an inspiration?
Dude, I've followed this game since like 2012. I'm so happy for all your success. I guess I need to ask a question. Here so forgive me if it's already been  asked but with kenshi how long do you plan to support it with updates when the second comes out? Also has anyone major approached you about bolstering your resources in exchange for more control over your ip?
Will Kenshi 2 have a job manager, akin to Dwarf Therapist or the one built into Rimworld? It'd be nice to mass toggle eg ""Jobs"" on and off. Similarly it'd be nice to assign ""roles"" to party members with pre-defined weapon/armor (like DF uniforms) and even minimum food and medical kit levels that they could pickup from storage when free to do so. Getting your guys ready for an expedition only for them to dump their food and medkits is annoying. (I know you can toggle ditch - I want GRANULAR control.)  Also, I love this game so much.
Hey bud! Big fan of Kenshi, I bought it and played it religiously for around a year back when it launched in preview on steam.  However I now move around a lot for work and cant afford to lug a big gaming pc or anything like that around but I do lug an xbox around, any chance for kenshi to come out on consoles? Or any plans for the second to release on consoles?
Where do Hivers come from?
Discord mod Fen here, just gonna copy over my question from there since it didn't make it to the curated list xP  --  Will there be a stronger focus on making sure the world works on a logistical level? i.e. all factions having a visible and discoverable chain of supplies, showing how they feed their people, supply their armies, and so on (within a realistic frame, similar to how we as players have to grow food, and mine and process ore)
Couple more questions from members of the Kenshi community who couldn't make it. :)  Asked by  @BluBOo on Discord and u/NinjaGregory on r/Kenshi: ""Will there be a terrain/height map editor for custom maps and/or map changes?""  Asked by  @papaya on Discord:  ""Are there any things that you wanted to implement in K1 that you didn't have time for/the ability to implement that you are now carrying forward into K2?"""

Some questions Reddit users might have to Jason Rogers are:,"When did you or those around you realize you had Olympic level talent?
What do you think is the worst part of this ""mental software"" you mentioned? (In terms of individual well-being).   By the way, congratulations!! For this process of telling your story. It is not just your case, for sure.
What is most important for the partners of men who might be struggling in these ways? What can  they do to be supportive? Would that answer be different for casual hookup vs relationship?
 What advice would you give to young men ?
Hi Jason! Fencer for ~7 years here, I’ve followed your story for a while and I find it very inspiring. How much do you feel weight is a factor in ones performance in fencing? I weigh about 195 but I’m pretty in shape (I don’t tire very easily), and I’m graduating college next week (I fenced at the collegiate club level). I want to lose some weight before nationals this year. How much of an impact do you think losing weight will have on my fencing? I feel like all else constant, I’ll be able to move more quickly but I really don’t know how much it will affect my performance overall. Thanks!
How many jokes do you hear about your sword when you talk about this?
I have a lot of respect for you and the trials you went through to overcome this. If you had to describe sexual performance anxiety to someone confused about their situation, how would you concisely define it? And how did you ultimately overcome it?
Are you still struggling with the performance anxiety? How have you treated it? What worked best? How (if possible) did you include your wife in this struggle? How can a sexual partner help?  *Asking as a wife of a wonderful man who also has “the issue”
When you lose a fencing match, do you get punny and say ""Curses, *foiled* again!""?
Trouble getting hard, staying hard or cumming too quickly?
Hey Jason,  We went to school together. I struggled for many years with similar issues. How come I'm not an Olympic athlete? JK. Cool to see you on reddit.
I'm late to the party, but I wanted to let you know that I read your article and I'm proud of you. I'm just a stranger but your poise, eloquence, and frank exploration of such a painful and personal struggle is commendable. Good luck on the road ahead, friend.      Do you think the situation is better for young men now than it was twenty years ago? Is our culture changing for the better?
As an Olympian, how do you feel about the assertion that the Olympics cause more harm than good in economic cost and that the athletes don't really benefit?
I fenced you in a NAC a few years ago and it remains one of the highlights of my fencing career.  So thanks for that.  What’s your opinion of the new cadre of men's epee, like hoyle and macdowald?  Would you ever do commentary?   If you put out a youtube channel doing bout analysis, I’d watch it.
Hi Jason,  I don’t *exactly* suffer from performance anxiety, but—even after 15 years of marriage to a beautiful woman (out of my league, for sure)—I continue to struggle with initiation anxiety. Once I’m warmed up, or if my wife initiates sex, I have no problem pleasuring and/or being pleasured. But when it comes to initiating sex, I become self-conscious and hyper-aware of my wife’s body-language.  I’ve been to a couple of therapists over the years, partly because of this issue, but I've never gotten past it.  My question: have you suffered from anxiety while *initiating* sex? If so (or even if not) do you have any wisdom to impart around that?
On the subject on women. What’s your experience with them when you can’t “perform”? Have you been open with your woman about it yet? And if so, how did it go?
Fair warning, I know Jack shit about fencing.  My question is this: if an opponent had a broadsword, would that be an advantage in competition? Why or why not?
Hey Jason, I haven’t struggled as much with not being able to get an erection, but often I find myself having a hard time getting to orgasm when I’m with a partner. Different type of performance, but did mention it with Hollywood girl in the article. Is this something you continued to struggle with, and if so what helped?
Whats the best life advice you got that had nothing to do with your success in fencing but actually helped in your journey to the Olympics?  Besides winning, what was your favorite thing about fencing?

How do people with no journalistic experience break into the field?  Is really just as easy as finding a story and hitting rec?
**Hey Tim, are you interested in a first hand account of a story involving millions of dead fish that had washed up on the shores of Vietnam last May?**  **The story was pretty much covered up because Vietnam controls almost all of the local media, and there is no protected freedom of speech or right to assemble.**   **But I witnessed a lot of events first-hand, and was meaning to send the story to Vice or a similar news outlet.**    -----   edit: Thanks for the encouragement to those who responded... I actually wrote a Medium post on this a couple of months back. Here it is: [""We Choose Fish""](https://medium.com/@danvineberg/we-choose-fish-40c882503472#.iiuh3ltpj)  It's a pretty detailed narrative (15 minute read). Ideally it would be shorter if published in a media outlet. I just wanted to get this truth out of me and on the page.   
Is it frustrating having to argue with colleagues and members of your profession that being dogmatic ideologues is antithetical to journalism itself? 
Do you think news is biased left or right in America?"
Some questions Reddit users might have to Chris Pratt are:,"Reddit appears to be Hooked on a Feeling.    Edit: I guess I need a question. Chris, do you know how much Reddit loves you?
i really just want to applaud him for this.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQhS2q7IHQM
What does Aubrey Plaza taste like?

Your first four questions are absolute shit, OP.  Just so you know  EDIT: Well OP edited his post to have good questions now. But originally they were literally ""What was it like being on _______?"" four times in a row. 
A better GotG question would be something along the lines of ""What was it like acting with two characters that aren't physically there?""
I'd love to ask him how annoying it is to be constantly asked about your body transformation.  I feel like no one interviews him without being like ""man, you were fat, now you're totally not, tell me more! Does your wife like buff you?"" and his answer is always in vein of ""I kind of still wish I was fat, dieting sucks""
How big is Batista's dick?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nHL1mFOdXY  
I'd like to see this happen. As a fellow Pratt, I do have some burning questions.  Like,  I feel like we are both humorous, happy people. But, when did our trees split where I got the fat genes? XD Who fucked up? 
most importantly, what was it like working on the oc?
Chris Pratt did the voice of Emmet in the Lego Movie?? STOP MAKING ME LOVE THIS MAN
Such generic questions.  It is like you haven't seen anything he was in so you couldn't ask about anything.  Why not ask about the fight scene he had with batista that they practiced for 2 months, but was changed last minute?  Or ask about how it was acting against a racoon that was not there?  How well did the stand in do?  Did anything stand out as the most difficult part of it?  
Chris Pratt why are you awesome? I wanna know about how you lived in maui smokin' weed with the homie in a van. What's the story?
If we looked at your actual room with a black light, just what would we see?
When are you and Aubrey going to do a Bert Macklin FBI movie?  It's literally the only question that needs answering and the only film I want to see made.
Guardians of the Galaxy isn't upcoming, it's already out?
Don't you want to be Nathan Drake in a potential Uncharted movie?
I was seriously just thinking this a few minutes ago. I've never even heard of him before a few weeks ago just from seeing him twice on the front page every day. So I guess my question would be, how does it feel to be up there with Nic Cage, Jennifer Lawrence, and Will Ferrell being worshipped by Reddit? 
Where are all the faces?!
When can we expect a Burt Macklin Parks and Rec spinoff?"
