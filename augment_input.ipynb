Although I never completed this degree I\\\\\\'ve been somewhat interested in journalism in one form or another over the years.\\\\n\\\\nIMO journalists/bloggers/writers very very rarely (it does happen, just not all the time) do it to make sure the public is uniformly educated about any subject. They do it to gain/retain readership which of course generates page hits for them. Not all journalists feel the desire to make bank but nearly all of them write for a secondary reason that goes beyond wanting Jane and John Q. Public to be properly informed about any given situation. This is one reason why I left journalism and moved to a different major way back in the day. I couldn\\\\\\'t stand what a couple of my professors were telling me. It was also one of the main reasons why my father left the journalism field. Depending on who you ask he either left on his own after getting fed up with the directives from the newspaper owner(s) OR was fired because he published articles that got mud on the owner(s) friends faces.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFrom several professors the basic \"rules\" for journalistic writing are:  \\\\n\\\\n1. Never lie. This will get you in trouble. Make sure facts are checked.\\\\n\\\\n2. Don\\\\\\'t ever give any facts that counter your position. This will weaken your position with your readers.\\\\n\\\\n3. Feel free to state your opinion as a fact. Yes, our professor actually spent 4 weeks out of 16 weeks showing how to do this.\\\\n\\\\n4. Strategically place adjectives/adverbs that support your position. \\\\n\\\\n5. As long as the above rules are followed feel free to take things out of context.\\\\n\\\\nWhen my father started his journalism career in the early 1970\\\\\\'s the primary aim was to make sure their audience was informed about all relevant issues that may impact them. Sometime later journalism was being used to change public perception for one special interest or another. Since then it\\\\\\'s evolved into what we have today.\\\\n\\\\nSo my question is do mainstream journalism schools/professors still teach the above stuff?

My crew was 4 others. Our driver decided they would head to the apt to see what was up and sure enough the door was open and several officers were outside. He decided to head back to us without confronting police.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the protests started dying down I called the national lawyers guild for advice. They told me that unless we directly interact with cops they can\\\\\\'t help us. Funny thing, about 15 minutes later as we drove we got surrounded by maybe a dozen police vehicles, some all black and tinted windows. They approached us with guns drawn and demanded they see our \"fucking hands.\"\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\\\'s the funny thing.\\\\n\\\\nBecause we had been planning on how to deal with the earlier police raid our adrenaline was high. When the cars surrounded us one crew member yells\\\\n\\\\n\"ITS HAPPENING!\"\\\\n\\\\nThey approached the vehicle pulled us out and searched everything. They asked me who I was, where I was from, what was I doing, why was I doing it, and more. They took our credit card numbers, passport information, etc.\\\\n\\\\nAfter about ten minutes a shorter cops walks over and waves his hand at me. A cop then uncuffs me and the shorter cops says \"youre vehicle matched a description\" and tells us we are free to go.\\\\n\\\\nThis is when we called the news and NLG.\\\\n\\\\nI decided that because of the raid and then the detainment only me and one other person with a large following would be allowed to re enter the apartment and we would livestream everything. Any perishable items would be discarded, vitamins, pills anything edible would be trashed.\\\\n\\\\nAs we were leaving another person who had been sharing the apartment with us arrived and asked for a ride. I said it would be fine as long as he followed my rules. This person became slightly agitated and stated they needed to grab something from inside the apartment. I refused, \"you enter the apartment thats fine, but you wont be riding with us.\" So he decides to just get in the car and stay quiet.\\\\n\\\\nAs we were leaving, heading to safe place to sleep, I got a text that the police had been talking about us on the radio scanner. This text came from someone we all trusted very much. I couldnt believe it though... seriously? Cops are actually targeting us?\\\\n\\\\nI get another text \"THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU ON THE SCANNER STOP GIVING INTEL\"\\\\n\\\\nI aimed my livestream down so you couldnt see where we were heading.\\\\n\\\\nWe got to a safe place on the southside of Chicago and went to sleep. Everything seemed fine.\\\\n\\\\nThe next day as we laughed about it, the one guy who tried to get something from inside laughed and said \\\\n\\\\n\"Isn\\\\\\'t it weird they[person who owned apartment] wanted me to bring adderall in the car?\"\\\\n\\\\nI basically shat a brick at that point... Apparently the person who lived in the apartment texted this guy asking him to grab drugs from inside and bring them with into our car.\\\\n\\\\n\"What the fuck are you talking about?\" I said\\\\n\\\\nHe responded \"Yea they asked me to bring adderall into the car\"\\\\n\\\\nTo which I said \"Why the fuck would they want you to take their drugs from their apartment? If we got pulled over and had that bottled we\\\\\\'d all be locked up right now.\"\\\\n\\\\nWe heard a rumor that the person who lived there recently started dating a cop. I don\\\\\\'t know if they actually tried pulling some bullshit on us, but I can say that it was possible. If it was true, I credit my planning for keeping me and my crew safe. \\\\n\\\\nThanks for reading!\\\\n\\\\n\\', \\'welcome to news in 2017.

This is for the news/web media.\\\\n\\\\nBut that said, here in Aus SBS Viceland is probably the best channel on TV given the absolute shit they feed us on tv here, and it really shows that Vice\\'s original roots are still there.\", \\'...you have just summarized the most important issue facing the world today, in my opinion.  To re-state & expand upon it:\\\\n\\\\nNews costs money to report.  In the modern world, it costs significantly *less* to report, though, which lowers the bar for entry:  \"The Press\" is not nearly as exclusive a job as it once was and with the entry of a flood of new publications and reporters into the market competition is drastically increased, which means that everyone in that market must work quite a bit harder to stay alive.  That means finding revenue either through direct patronage or advertising.  Direct patronage (subscribers, a government, etc) is problematic because one becomes beholden to the patron, and therefore more likely to report \"news\" that will be agreeable to them - even if this urge is only subconscious.  Advertising is just patronage with a degree of separation, and the advertisers will want to make money off of your venture as well so the margins are narrower.  There\\\\\\'s constant pressure to increase circulation while also appealing to the advertisers\\\\\\' core market demographic and simultaneously not offending that demographic or the advertiser, even if (again) only subconsciously.\\\\n\\\\nThis would be bad enough on its own, but human beings are, frankly, weak and fickle creatures.  We like to be right, and we *especially* love it when authority figures tell us that we are right and smart and therefore good.  So we tend to seek out \"news\" (read: \"facts\" - because reporting is a framing of facts in context, and context can be \"spun\" but we forget / ignore that) that not only agrees with us, but we will abandon a news source that challenges our beliefs.  In other words confirmation bias is a thing, and everyone has it, full stop.\\\\n\\\\nSo people gravitate towards the \"news\" that agrees with them, and this causes news outlets to cater to more polarized versions of the same story that begin to resemble reality less and less.  News organizations and reporters that fail to follow this trend get left behind and go broke.  Meanwhile we all bumble along telling ourselves that we know what\\\\\\'s going on - after all we read the news, we\\\\\\'re well informed.  \\\\n\\\\nYet when someone tells us something that disagrees with what we believe we\\\\\\'re quick to dismiss it and as things spiral further out of control stories that have very little relationship with reality enter the market and enjoy success to some degree because at least some people will believe it.  Advertising and propaganda masquerading as journalism will get past enough people\\\\\\'s BS sensors that it\\\\\\'s worthwhile to publish.  These employ a conscious effort to appeal to the patron(s) and advertisers, but it\\\\\\'s easy to make it at least *look like* \"journalism.\"\\\\n\\\\nSometimes other news agencies will report on the fakery, if only to debunk it.  The people who believe the fake stories and don\\\\\\'t completely trust the outlets doing the debunking will see this as an attack on their reality, while the fake outlets seize upon it as validation:  The corrupt Old Media lies! Trust us for The Truth!  This is where we are right now.\\\\n\\\\nMost people have consumed and believed at least one outright lie masquerading as a \"news report\" in the last year.  You\\\\\\'re most likely in this group, so am I.  The problem is, we do not know what it was and it\\\\\\'s pretty unlikely we\\\\\\'ll discover all of the incorrect things we believe.  We simply have to do our best to ensure that the information we base our important decisions on is valid.  The individual citizen is now responsible for fact-checking and data verification, so critical thinking skills are of utmost importance.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately critical thinking skills aren\\\\\\'t standard education for the vast majority of people.\\', \\'Seriously how is that just gliding by in this while ama? \"They don\\\\\\'t seem to have a bias, they just write towards the younger generation\"\\\\nWhat a lovely way of describing what your bias IS\\', \\'I mean thats basically what I do... shit should I be promoting my patreon?\\', \\'Yea no idea. we think they tried planting drugs on us too but thats the longer version of the story.\\', \\'The full story is significantly crazier.\\\\n\\\\nLong story short, the cops followed up sort of.

He lost the popular vote by the largest margin in modern history, he entered office with the lowest approval in history, his inauguration was met by the largest protest in history, and his platform represents attitudes that are not shared by mainstream America, re: climate change, free press, freedom of assembly, reproductive rights, regulations, healthcare, environmental protections, public education, etc etc.\\\\n\\\\nSo why did he win the EC?

A lot of the modern left stands for the notion -- bizarrely, all but unchallenged for years now -- that everyone has a fundamental human right to come to America and be a citizen here. I think *most* of the opposition to Trump is because he has shattered that false consensus and revealed that the donor class can\\'t unitarily set the agenda vis a vis immigration.\\\\n\\\\n> Even if global warming is wrong (which I think we need to take corrective action, but it\\'s besides the point) why not slow down the rate of pollution it certainly doesn\\'t hurt.\\\\n\\\\nIt does hurt. It\\'s very expensive, which is why we haven\\'t done it.\\\\n\\\\nI actually don\\'t really disagree with the rest of your points. I think you\\'re right that manufacturing is not going to come back to anything like what it was in the fifties, that the issues hurting the blue collar class are predominantly technological (though also involve free trade), etc.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, none of that means that we shouldn\\'t fight for the American middle class and do what *can* be done, and so far it seems like Trump is the only politician who is dedicated to that. The idea that an American President would predominantly look out for American interests seems like common sense but he\\'s the only one to really commit to it (and astonishingly received a fair amount of pushback). And I agree that his comments about the inauguration crowd sizes were petty and dumb but also pretty meaningless, and I\\'m glad he\\'s going to do a study to find out how much illegal voting there really is -- it will probably prove him wrong, and if it doesn\\'t, so much the better if he spotted something that the rest of us didn\\'t.\", \"> We don\\'t like someone who ignores hard science.\\\\n\\\\nLike George W.
