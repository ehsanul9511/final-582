It also hurts small time streamers because it discourages channel surfing since you’re more likely to get hit with an advertisement everytime you switch to another stream).

This is just stuff I\'ve picked up of doing keto off and on over the years. My husband and I do keto for 40 weeks out of the year, and the other 12 are non-keto (holidays/birthdays/etc.). It works for us and breaks the monotony. Plus, ain\'t nobody gonna tell me I can\'t have mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving.\n\nSo, as I understand it, the four components that people look at for cholesterol is HDL (the good one), LDL (the bad one), triglycerides, and your triglyceride/HDL ratio. With keto, all of these can spike due to the increase fat that you are ingesting. HOWEVER, there are effectively two particle types for LDL. Sub-LDL, if you will. Particle One is terrible for you, clogs your arteries, bad at parties, you get the idea. Particle Two is actually not terrible. It\'s a higher density lipid that is less likely to clog arteries than Particle One. You\'d take a ""Particle Test"" if you were about to go on statins (or maybe you\'d have to specifically request it. I\'m not 100% sure as I\'ve never had to do this.) Point being, due to these particles mucking up what might otherwise be a black and white issue, most people look at the triglyceride/HDL ratio to determine the health of your cardiovascular system.\n\nPersonally, I do it because Type-2 diabetes is so rampant in my family that I\'m almost guaranteed to get it if I don\'t keep on it. But, like any diet, it\'s not for everyone. Some people are extremely responsive to the fat in their diet. Some go on keto and their numbers go down. It\'s entirely dependent on what you are comfortable with, what your doctor says, and lifestyle. Anyone who says this is a diet for everyone is selling something.\n\nFor reference, as of right now, I am sitting at a triglyceride/HDL ratio of 2.8 with triglycerides at 58, LDL at 102 (which is a wee bit high), HDL at 63, and total cholesterol at 179.

I don't go to restaurants very often and when I do I can only order dishes with plain meat and vegetables, which is usually a chicken Caesar salad with no dressing.

Other people in this thread have explained the issues with relying on CICO so I won't go into that, but CICO people think that if anyone deviates from what they feel is clearly correct, then it's scientific heresy on the scale of flat earthers.

It is well corellated to CVD and that *has* stood the test of time.\n\nWhich brings me to the next point.\n\n> Elderly patients and people with high LDL-C live just as long or longer than those with normal or low LDL-C.\n\nThis is also true.  Unfortunately, because you (apparently?  I'm guessing?) do not have much training in statistics, you have drawn the wrong conclusion.\n\nYES people who reach very advanced ages have high LDL-C.\n\nBut you don't seem to understand that the vast, vast majority of people with high LDL-C are all dead by that point.  If I have a 50-year-old in front of me with high LDL-C, the reality is that I am looking at someone who will die early, not someone who will live another 50 years.\n\nIf they live to 65 without having a heart attack or stroke, they may be one of those rare people whose LDL-C is naturally high at baseline, and I can safely stop the statin.

I do not think it is an accident that the only other cholesterol-lowering drugs with any benefit to CVD risk are also anti-inflammatory (PCKS9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, etc).  My statement here is pretty controversial, but I think the inflammatory model explains more of the observed behavior both natively and when under the influence of pharmaceuticals.\n\n> Statin treatment may cause many serious side effects, \n\nThat is true.\n\n> which more than offset the negligible benefits.\n\nThis is not a decision you are qualified to make.\n\nAll of the debate regarding statins is surrounding primary prevention.  When it comes to secondary prevention, statins are well demonstrated to be helpful at all ages.\n\nThe risk/benefit discussion and decision is different for every person.  It is not appropriate for you to project your personal risk tolerance and benefit appetite on other people, or attempt to make their medical decisions for them.\n\nKeto is great.

""Captain Meredith, of the Royal Artillery, being an acquaintance. I had seen him very frequently, previous to his going on camp duty in 1794, but then he had no disease; however, he always had impressed me, from his being a large corpulent person, with the idea that he was not unlikely to fall into disease. (Editor: Another instance of Rollo\'s clinical acuteness.)"" ""On the 12th of June, 1796, he visited me, and though I was at once struck with the diminution of his size, yet, at the same time, the colour of his face being ruddy, I received no impression, otherwise than of his being in health: a moment\'s conversation, however, convinced me of the contrary ......\xa0\n\n""He complained of great thirst and a keenness of appetite; his skin was hot, dry and parched; and his pulse small and quick. He told me his complaints had been attributed to an old disease, and a liver affection. The thirst, dry skin, and quick pulse, marking a febrile state, depending probably on some local circumstance, and connecting these with the keenness of appetite, Diabetes immediately suggested itself to me. I enquired into the state of his urine, which I found in quantity and colour to be characteristic of the disease; and was at the same time much surprised, that for the two or three months he had been under the care of a Physician and Surgeon, the circumstance of the increased urine had not been known to them. The patient told me, as he drank so much, the quantity of urine had appeared to him a necessary consequence; and of course never having been asked about it, he gave no information. I directed him to keep the urine he next passed, and, on examination, it was found to be sweet; in consequence of which the disease became sufficiently ascertained.""\xa0\n\nAt another point in the case history, Rollo states that Captain Meredith was 34 years of age and was 71 3/4 inches tall. At the time of beginning of the special treatment, the symptoms of diabetes had been present seven months or more and his weight had fallen from 232 to 162 pounds. A view held by some at that time was that diabetes was a primary affection of the kidneys. However, Rollo developed the idea that the disease was ""a primary and peculiar affection"" of the stomach in which, due to some morbid changes in ""the natural powers of digestion and assimilation,"" sugar or saccharine material was formed in that organ, chiefly from vegetable matter. It was on this basis that he advocated the use of an animal diet together with certain medication designed to quiet the overactive stomach and to diminish the appetite.\xa0\n\nFollowing initial bloodlettings, Rollo\'s treatment of Captain Meredith was as follows:\xa0\n\n""1st. **The diet to consist of animal food principally**, and to be thus regulated:\xa0\n\nBreakfast. One and a half pint of milk and half a pint of lime-water, mixed together; and bread and butter.\xa0\n\nNoon. Plain blood-puddings, made of blood and suet only.\xa0\n\nDinner.

Flannel to be worn next the skin. The gentlest exercise to be only permitted; but confinement to be preferred.""\xa0\n\n""4thly. A draught at bed-time of twenty drops of tartarized antimonial wine and twenty-five of tincture of opium; and the quantities to be gradually increased. In reserve, as substances diminishing action, tobacco and foxglove. ""\xa0\n\n""5thly. An ulceration, about the size of half a crown, to be produced and maintained externally, and immediately opposite to each kidney. And,\xa0\n\n""6thly. A pill of equal parts aloes and soap, to keep the bowels regularly open.""\n\nTherapy\xa0\n\nA special diabetic diet was undoubtedly one of the foremost therapeutic measures, even before the age of insulin. Even before it was recognized that diabetes was a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism, various kinds of diet had been recommended. A change to a diet decided purely pragmatically, which was nevertheless very effective, did not come until JOHN ROLLO (d. 1809), a Scottish physician, who, in 1797, had achieved good results with a meat diet, made his recommendation (MARBLE; ANDERSON; BECKENDORF). He gave a particularly detailed account \xa0The History of Diabetes mellitus 85 of the case of Captain MEREDITH of the Royal Artillery, who became diabetic at the age of 34, and who was very obviously overweight. His diet consisted of a breakfast and supper of milk mixed with lime-water and bread and butter, while his dinner consisted of pudding made of fat and blood and mature, preferably rank pork. In this way he had - without being conscious of it - excluded carbohydrates almost entirely from the diet. The patient of course lost a great deal of weight and felt extremely well.\xa0\n\nA second patient was less cooperative and therefore died at the age of 57, 19 months after treatment was begun, mainly - as ROLLO pointed out - because during his last three months he indulged in such things as apple pudding, sugar in his tea, and wine.\xa0\n\nThe ""meat diet"" was used well into the 19th century, although gradually it was considered wiser not to cut out all carbohydrates, and patients had a certain amount of carbohydrate added to their diet, even though that caused some glycosuria. This kind of diet was initiated in the middle of the 19th century, mainly by ADOLF NIKOLAUS VON DURING (1820-1882) and RUDOLF EDUARD KULZ (1845-1895). The latter even distinguished between harmful and harmless carbohydrates and found that levulose, inulin, inosit, mannite, and lactose, as well as some root vegetables like celery, comfrey, etc. caused no deterioration of the metabolic condition. But it remains true that many specialists did recommend a carbohydrate-free diet with a lot of meat and fat (DICKINSON; PAVY; SEEGEN; R. SCHUMACHER, STEPP).\xa0\n\n[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-48364-6\\_15](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-48364-6_15)', 'score': 45}, {'body': ""> These diet peddlers are the new snake oil salesmen.\n\nEh, not really.

A 1.52-MJ (362-kcal) fat supplement produced no detectable action on measures of appetite at any time point. Therefore, fat and carbohydrate do not have identical effects on the appetite profile. In a further study in obese subjects, a novel experimental design was used to assess the satiating efficiency and compensatory response of fat. Eating from a range of either high-fat or high-carbohydrate foods, obese subjects voluntarily consumed twice as much energy from the fat items, thereby indicating a weak action of fat on satiation. In turn, this large intake of fat exerted a disproportionately weak effect on satiety. These studies suggest that the appetite-control system may have only weak inhibitory mechanisms to prevent the passive overconsumption of dietary fat. The results indicate how this action could induce a positive energy balance and lead to a gradual upward drift in body mass index.” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/8475895/\n\n“ The macronutrient composition of the diet can influence hunger, satiety, food intake, body weight, and body composition. Fat, not carbohydrate, is the macronutrient associated with overeating and obesity. Fat is overeaten because it is highly palatable and because it provides a high level of energy in a given volume of food. However, when given in equal volumes, carbohydrate (sugar) and fat have similar effects on hunger, satiety, and subsequent food intake when infused intragastrically or ingested in foods by normal-weight, unrestrained young men. In obese and restrained subjects, preloads of high-carbohydrate yogurts suppress subsequent food intake more than do high-fat yogurts, indicating a relative insensitivity to the satiety value of fat.” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7900695/\n\n“We examined 41 the effects of ad libitum and isoenergetic meals varying in fat and carbohydrate on 42 satiety, energy intake and food hedonics. In all, sixty-five overweight and obese 43 individuals (BMI = 30.9 ± 3.8 kg/m2) completed two separate test meal days in a 44 randomised order in which they consumed high-fat/low-carbohydrate (HFLC) or low- 45 fat/high-carbohydrate (LFHC) foods. Satiety was measured using subjective appetite 46 ratings to calculate the satiety quotient. Satiation was assessed by intake at ad libitum 47 meals. Hedonic measures of explicit liking (subjective ratings) and implicit wanting 48 (speed of forced-choice) for an array of HFLC and LFHC foods were also tested 49 before and after isoenergetic HFLC and LFHC meals. The satiety quotient was greater 50 after ad libitum and isoenergetic meals during the LFHC condition compared to the 51 HFLC condition (P = 0.006 and P = 0.001, respectively), while ad libitum energy 52 intake was lower in the LFHC condition (P < 0.001). Importantly, the LFHC meal 53 also reduced explicit liking (P < 0.001) and implicit wanting (P = 0.013) for HFLC 54 foods compared to the isoenergetic HFLC meal, which failed to suppress the hedonic 55 appeal of subsequent HFLC foods. Therefore, when coupled with increased satiety 56 and lower energy intake, the greater suppression of hedonic appeal for high-fat food 57 seen with LFHC foods provides a further mechanism for why these foods promote 58 better short-term appetite control than HFLC foods.“ https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88aa/67a0b531fdbfc5689b5dd0f311ecffa41b85.pdf\n\n“ RESULTS: There were significant differences in satiety both within and between the six food categories.

Subjects selected their meals from a list con- taming a large variety of common food, which had a food quotient greater than 0.85 for the HC diet and less than 0.85 for the HF diet. The average ad libitum intake was 14.41 ± 0.85 MJ/d (67%, 18%, and 15% of energy as carbohydrate, fat, and protein, respectively) with the HC diet and I8.25 ± 0.90 MJ/d (26%, 6 1%, and I3% of energy as carbohydrate, fat, and protein, respectively) with the HF diet.

During the 2 test days, cumulative carbohydrate storage was 418 ± 72 and 205 ± 47 g, and fat balance was 29 ± 17 and 291 ± 29 g with the HC and HF diets, respectively.

Taubes quoted Farquhar, but misrepresented his views. “What a disaster,” says Farquhar.  \n>  \n>“The article was incredibly misleading,” says Gerald Reaven, the pioneering Stanford University researcher, now emeritus, who coined the term “Syndrome X.” “My quote was correct, but the context suggested that I support eating saturated fat. I was horrified.”  \n>  \n>“I was greatly offended at how Gary Taubes tricked us all into coming across as supporters of the Atkins diet,” says Stanford’s John Farquhar.\n\nAgain, these are people who Taubes himself claims to be supporters of his diet (except PiSunyer, that one he ignored because his findings contradicted him).\n\n>The New York Times Magazine isn’t the National Enquirer. Readers expect The Times to run articles that are honestly reported and written.

For example, The Post asked Taubes why he made no mention of a review of nearly 50 studies on weight loss in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s 1998 Clinical Guidelines on treating obesity. The panel of experts was chaired by Columbia University’s Pi-Sunyer, who has served as president of both the American Society of Clinical Nutrition and the American Diabetes Association.  \n>  \n>“Anything that Pi-Sunyer is involved with, I don’t take seriously,” said Taubes. “He just didn’t strike me as a scientist.”  \n>  \n>If Taubes had written a news article for the front page of The Times, comments like those would have ended his career.

Be really careful as from 50hz-200hz you dont really have a lot of room to mix with, and this space should be reserved to kick/bass generally, and sometimes a low tom or a hip-hop/DnB snare to get that extra \'UMF\' that those kinds of snares bring. this could easily be one of the most time consuming parts and one of the firsts things I personally use a lot of time on when creating new tracks.\n\nAfter that comes compression. this one has a lot of tricks to it, but you are generally removing dynamics from the track in favor of having a equal amount of \'noise-level\' throughout the song. how much is up to you, but i tend to just set it to compress it somewhat lightly in the beginning so everything evens out. this step could add more punch to drums, make a guitar sound \'fatter\', and really increase the amplitude of a background synth if you really want to.\n\nSo in the song i linked above, you can hear all the sounds just sounds a bit muffled, the drums lack punch, however there are generally no conflict (i.e. no sounds competing over a range of frequencies). Also note that the bass, while it has a sub it has also a sound that plays in the \'not bass range\' (over 200hz) and some of the keys at the start does dip into the bass range, and that could potentially be a issue \n\ngenerally in this stage i imagine the different sounds as balls and i want to try to make them as round as possible, trying to remove any rough edges and spikes of sound that should not be there. this takes most of all experience as overmixing in this step could add more work later as you could add conflict\n\n---\n\n## some mixing done\nhttps://soundcloud.com/thirdbeat/topp-2-v2/s-7BMVN\n\nI removed the worst of the bass frequencies form the keys, but I do need some, because its part of that instruments character to have sound there. Drums are somewhat better. i added a secondary kick because the original lacked bass and a secondary snare and heavily compressed the original drums. you can hear this on the hi-hats. i also added amplitude to the high frequencies of the entire song, layer by layer.\n\n## Final mix\nNow comes the fun part. this is where you decide if you want to add effects and decide if you want to pan anything to the sides in order to create a \'wider mix\'. \n\nImagine you are standing in a room with 1 speaker per track in-front of you; where in the room would you place each speaker?   \n\n* do you want them further back? (room reverb)\n* to one side? (panning)\n* turned around? (phase reversing)\n* inside a closet? (filtering/equing as a effect)\n* split into many smaller speakers and delayed just a fraction per speaker? (unison)\n* away in the big hall in the next room over? (long reverb)\n* how big is the room with the speakers, and are there los of reverb in the room itself?\n* you decide.  \n\nI would guess most artists use alot of time here, and normally this is a part of doing the sound design when creating, however there are times where you start with completley dry stuff (no effects) and you just have to figure it out. Most of what people refer to as \'sound\', ie \'artist x has such a cool sound\' comes from this step. this is also where you need to be most careful as the ear-fatigue can set in quickly and you could potentially add shit that does not fly well with the rest of the song.\n\nin the end you get something like this:  \nhttps://soundcloud.com/thirdbeat/my-theme-topp-2\n\n## Final thoughts\nTo have a good mix is ESSENTIAL if you want any of your music be replayed. most people CAN hear when something about a song is off, but very few can hear exacly why its off, and how to fix this. this goes for myself aswell. listen to this shitty mix i created: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vk7zqbya2zhrosg/house%2043%282%29.mp3?dl=0, and listen to the final \n mix after me and a buddy of mine that actually does mixing professionally sat down for a day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGUo-G3LhIY (vocals in norwegian) .. it\'s basically night and day\n\n\n## note about matering  \nAfter final mix comes mastering.  \nBack in the day this was neccecary to make sure that if you had any sudden jumps in amplitude of the song that the vinly needle wouldn\'t physically jump out of the track, and also to make sure that the sound of all of the songs combines sounded more or less similar.\nnowdays, this step can take the song from really high quality to amazing quality and a good mastering can really make a track shine. its the final polish, and should never be used to fix any mixing mistakes. take a look at this guy comparing different mastering services to hear the difference in songs. the whole video is great but, il just link to the where he listens to the different versions: https://youtu.be/IR7WV_F0GCQ?t=1264', 'score': 2}, {'body': ""Hell yeah brother/sister keep up the good fight.
